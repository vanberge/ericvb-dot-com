					<description><![CDATA[Christine Ann,
I love you a &quot;hundred million&quot; and want you to know that the feelings you have are normal and &quot;go with the territory&quot;.  Please take care of yourself and when needed/wanted, let those who are around you and love you, help out.  We won&#039;t be able to guess, so just let us know.

This new little VanBergen/Johnson already has my &quot;hundred million&quot; as well!

Love,
Mom]]></description>
