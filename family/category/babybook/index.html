				<div class="entry">
					<p>2014 is the year that our &#8220;family&#8221; has really hit began to hit it&#8217;s stride.</p>
<p><strong>Carter</strong><br />
Carter turned 1, and has really started to gain a personality.  He communicates mostly non-verbally now by pointing, grunting, and shaking his head yes/no.  He tries a few baby-signs for &#8220;more&#8221; and then confirms or denies when we ask him.  His head nod for &#8220;yes&#8221; cracks me up because he has to move his whole upper body.  He&#8217;s walking, climbing, and loves to do laps in our living room and go up/down the stairs repeatedly.</p>
<p>The kid has toughed through a good cold and a couple rounds of ear infections without even letting that break his stride.  We didn&#8217;t even know he had an ear infection until he had a 1 year checkup in mid December.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s starting to try and talk.  If I say &#8220;High Five!&#8221; and hold my hand out, he puts the right number of syllables together and mostly matches the tone as he slaps at my hand.  He will throw out &#8220;Wow!&#8221; and &#8220;Uh oh&#8221; from time to time &#8211; and periodically we catch Ma-ma / Da-Da / Pa-pa used mostly in the right context. </p>
<p>The level of interaction continues to increase across the board &#8211; especially with Chase.  They find ways to play together, to steal each other&#8217;s toys, and be exactly what I hoped brothers would be. </p>
<p><strong>Chase</strong><br />
Chase at 4 has been my favorite part of being a parent so far.  We can start to experience things together and learn and discover as a team.  He may ask me &#8220;What&#8217;s this car&#8217;s name?&#8221; &#8211; some toy from one of the new Cars movies &#8211; and we&#8217;ll find out together.  Or, he&#8217;ll ask a question that doesn&#8217;t really have an answer and we collectively imagine answers. &#8220;How could we get touch the sky?&#8221; for example.  However, he&#8217;s managed to start asking some tough questions that I wasn&#8217;t really prepared for.</p>
<p>Chase: When the dinosaurs were here, we were just bones, right?<br />
Me (confidently): No, actually we weren&#8217;t even here yet.<br />
Chase: Well, where were we??<br />
Me: Uhhhhh&#8230;..<br />
Chase:  When will dinosaurs be alive again?</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a smart kid and is patient enough for me to explain almost any topic he asks about, which is good because some of these tougher questions required me to think pretty hard on an answer&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting shift in my personality as well.  The things I want to do now revolve around how fun they&#8217;ll be for <em>us</em> to do.  I&#8217;ll take an evening go-cart race at Craig&#8217;s Cruisers over almost anything I used to do for fun by myself &#8211; as long as Chase is in the seat next to me in the cart. We can laugh together about the fart gun in Despicable Me, and I enjoyed that way more than Bill Burr&#8217;s comedy special that I watched by myself.</p>
<p>We have to balance how much he wants to watch Iron Man, Legends of Chima, or Ninjago &#8212; But we manage to get outside as well where he prefers Soccer, &#8220;Pretend football&#8221; so he can catch, and basketball on our hoop&#8217;s lowest setting.</p>
<p>Haircuts continue to be interesting.  We&#8217;ve never taken him to get a &#8220;real&#8221; haircut, mostly because I&#8217;m pretty decent at cutting hair and have a professional grade set of tools.  So for now Chase is rocking a mostly real-looking haircut instead of a typical buzzcut.  Normally, we&#8217;d do a #2 clipper on the back/sides, a 4 on the top, and a 3 to blend it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure every year continues to get better and better as a parent.  But 2014 was a pretty solid one for the VanBergen family.</p>

				<small>Thursday, October 2nd, 2014</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I can remember when we first had Chase, it seemed like there was such a focus on a sleeping schedule.  With our first kid, we didn&#8217;t know any better.  We didn&#8217;t know what &#8220;normal&#8221; meant.  We went off of parenting books and everyday conversations.  The books heavily referred to establishing a sleeping schedule, and many conversations about parenting started with &#8220;is he sleeping through the night?&#8221;  I felt like a failure if I had to say &#8220;no&#8221;.  Well, on to kid 2 and I realize that is BS.</p>
<p>Carter is almost a year old now, and he still wakes up twice almost every night.  And this time, I don&#8217;t care.  We haven&#8217;t let him cry it out.  We haven&#8217;t let him &#8220;self soothe&#8221;.  The way I see it, he&#8217;s waking up for a reason and I&#8217;m not going to let him cry until he&#8217;s so tired that his body forgets it was hungry.  He needs whatever he needs, and I&#8217;m happy to read the signals and provide whatever that is.  The kid is off the charts 99th percentile for height.  Yet he&#8217;s only around the middle of the pack for weight.  That tells me that he has an insane metabolism which I think he gets from my side of the family.  Laugh all you want, but the way my brother and I consumed calories throughout our 20&#8217;s compared to our exercise levels; we should have weighed 350 pounds.   So if my kid cries at 5am after eating just at midnight or 1, I&#8217;m going to feed him.</p>
<p>This mindset, which I will maintain is correct, comes at a cost.</p>
<p>That cost is sleeping arrangements.  It&#8217;s a merry go-round of options that changes every single day in our family.  Some days Chase sleeps in his own bed by himself.  Most days Chris sleeps in Chase&#8217;s bed by herself while Chase sleeps with me in our king size bed.  Some days I end up in our recliner while Chris ends up with Chase.  It just depends on how the night goes and who ended up getting up with Carter throughout the night.  Is that a little bit chaotic sometimes? Sure.  Would I want to change it?  Nope.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a piece of this that I cherish, and that is having Chase want to sleep in the same bed as his dad.  At some point it will be wierd.  At some point he won&#8217;t want to do it.  And when that happens, I&#8217;m going to miss it.  The nightly routine of reading some books together and talking about life gives me a great perspective on him as a person.   Instead of being negative about how the sleep schedule is crazy and changes daily, I&#8217;m looking at what pieces I&#8217;ll miss after everything finally does go  back to normal.</p>
<p>For now, the sleeping is what it is, and it&#8217;s normal for our family.  That&#8217;s good enough for me.</p>

					<p>February was a brutal month for the VanBergen family.</p>
<p>It all started after a fun weekend visiting the Grandparents up north.  Sunday night as the weekend came to a close, I started experiencing a norovirus/stomach flu like illness.  This spread to every adult who was around us over that weekend.  Grandma V, Grandpa V, Uncle Vanbergs, Aunt Kayla, myself and Chris all got similar symptoms within about 12 hours of each other.  That level of contagiousness just seemed insane.  A week later, the virus was apparently still around as Grandma and Grandpa J and uncle Dale all got it from a followup visit to our house&#8230; It was just nuts!  The main symptoms only lasted about 24 hours and then you were back on your feet within 48 hours or so (except in my case, more on this later though).</p>
<p>Then Carter started getting badly congested and really had a terrible cough.  We took him to his pediatrician 2 times to make sure it wasn&#8217;t affecting his breathing and that his lungs were still clear.  It was pretty scary for me because some of the coughing fits he experienced really made him struggle to catch his breath in between coughs and would last what felt like minutes at a time.  This congestion worked its way throughout his entire Ear/nose/throat system and left him with a dual ear infection.  Which then led to antibiotics.  Which led to terrible baby diarrhea.  Which led to blistered baby bottom despite copious amounts of Desitin diaper rash cream.  Chris and I kept him home from daycare an entire week plus a couple days into the following week before he was well enough all around to make it back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while everyone else recovered from the stomach bug swimmingly, my symptoms worsened.  A couple doctor visits and I end up with GI track inflammation and a bladder infection.  My doc thinks it possibly developed into diverticulitis and he put me on 2 different antibiotics.  This really began doing the trick immediately; but I was also on a fairly strict diet of bland food and clear liquids only.  I really think this was the sickest I&#8217;ve ever been.  The bird like diet with this type of illness combined to lose me 19 pounds over a 14 day span of time.</p>
<p>Chase somehow managed to avoid EVERYTHING.  Which leads me to believe he&#8217;s the one that spread all these germs to everybody. </p>
<p>Finally, after what feels like forever, things have improved&#8230;  We went on a disinfecting spree, washed all bedding from all bedrooms, and even opened all our windows to air out our house in near-zero temperatures. This terrible couple week span only adds to how much this winter has absolutely sucked.  We&#8217;re all feeling claustrophobic and more often than not it&#8217;s been a struggle to keep everyone occupied. It&#8217;s important to remember the good times as well as the bad.  February, you were pretty bad&#8230;   </p>

					<p>Carter John VanBergen was born on 11/12/2013 at 9:20am. At 21.5 inches long, and 8 lbs, 9 oz he is a good sized baby!<br />
<a href="http://www.ericvb.com/family/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_20131112_102915.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-203" alt="IMG_20131112_102915" src="http://www.ericvb.com/family/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_20131112_102915-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_20131112_102915-300x225.jpg 300w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_20131112_102915-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Being the 2nd time around for mom and dad, one could say we cut some corners. We didn&#8217;t go to any baby classes. We didn&#8217;t take pictures or blog every facet of the pregnancy. We felt like we were pros. This over confidence caused a bit of procrastination on Dad&#8217;s part. &#8220;Oh, we have 4 weeks to get the room ready, paint, get out clothes, car seats, bottles, etc?&#8221; &#8230; Granted, much of that was busy work and we did get it done with plenty of time to spare, but I was surprised at how much I&#8217;m having to relearn already only 5 days into Carter&#8217;s life. Anyway, with all the slacking, I&#8217;m going to try and put a pregnancy worth of cliffnotes into one blog post. 🙂</p>
<p>We did not find out ahead of time whether you were a boy or a girl. I fought this a bit, because I wanted to know if we had to rebuy everything, or rebuy nothing. But after this experience I decided I&#8217;d never want to find out again, and am glad we didn&#8217;t. There is no way I can describe what that moment is like. There&#8217;s nothing else like it. When I saw you were a boy, I lost it and cried as I simultaneously told your mom the news.</p>
<p>Your room is a boring color, I&#8217;m sorry. This is what has to happen when you don&#8217;t find out ahead of time. A light shade of green comparable to maybe the center of a kiwi. But, you&#8217;re in our new house! Your brother Chase got to help me do a little painting. I also dropped a roll of frog tape down our HVAC vent never to be retrieved. In traditional little brother fashion, you get Chase&#8217;s hand me down crib, dresser, clothes, rocker. Sorry in advance for a lifetime of this. I&#8217;ll let you get away with more than Chase to make up for it.</p>
<p>You were alot easier on your mom during birth than Chase was. I think the entirety of your labor was maybe 5 hours, vs over 19 hours for Chase. Your mom did a great job! A few rounds of pushing through contractions and there you were. Your head was perfectly round and you had fuzzy wolfman ears.</p>
<p>Chase has been amazing. He frequently wants to see you, share his toys, hold you, and help with feedings.<br />
Chase may have enjoyed your birthday more than we did. He got &#8220;big brother&#8221; presents from everybody.</p>
<p>Some random memories I&#8217;ve kept in my mind wanting to share:</p>
<ul>
<li>On our way to the hospital, &#8220;Sweet child O&#8217; mine&#8221; was playing on the radio.</li>
<li>The very first thing you did as they put you on your mommy&#8217;s chest was to squeeze my finger.</li>
<li>You peed on your own face when you were 16 hours old.</li>
<li>You eat like crazy.  Doctor said &#8220;Yeah anywhere between 20-30 oz&#8221;.  Well, you eat 40+ every time.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all that said, the most amazing aspect of this experience is seeing the genesis of a brother&#8217;s relationship. This is something I really hoped for and looked forward to, because I cannot put into words what it means. I am lucky enough to have it with my brother, and I&#8217;m so thankful for that to continue with my sons.</p>

<p>We promise we&#8217;re going to be better about sharing these kinds of things more often now.  4 months without anything is pretty bad.  🙁</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Welcome to the world, little man&#8230;</p>
<p>Your name is Chase Michael VanBergen.  You were born at 9:33pm on April 14th.  You weighed 7 pounds, 7 ounces when you were born, and you were 20 inches long.</p>
<p>Your mom and I were so happy to finally meet you!  Once we saw you were a boy, we agreed right away on your name.  &#8220;Chase&#8221; seemed to really fit you for some reason, so hopefully you like it as much as we do.  You share your middle name &#8220;Michael&#8221; with your father, and it&#8217;s also your Grandfather&#8217;s first name.  I am proud to share that with you, and I know your Grandpa is as well.</p>
<p>Your Mother seemed to always know you were going to be a boy, and really that&#8217;s where the odds pointed.  I, on the other hand, seemed to guess against the odds thinking you were going to be a girl&#8230;  But I&#8217;m very glad that you turned out to be exactly who you are.  You have changed our lives forever for the better, and we&#8217;re both looking forward to growing as parents, learning along the way, and helping you become the best little man you can be.</p>
<p>This picture of you was taken just minutes after you were born.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/family/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/DSCF1018-e1271504225973.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-117" title="Baby Chase" src="http://www.ericvb.com/family/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/DSCF1018-e1271504327467.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;re here, we&#8217;ve been working on dropping the &#8220;Baby Van&#8221; label that you were given early on&#8230;  In a way, it was like a name for you before you were born.  I&#8217;m using &#8220;Baby Chase&#8221; to help me transition &#8211; because I still have a tendency to say Baby Van.</p>
<p>This experience has been amazing, but I can see how parents look back and say &#8220;it all happened so fast&#8221; &#8211; because it really has.  The 9 months of pregnancy seems to have just flown by&#8230;  and even though your Mom went through a 19 hour labor with you, the anticipation and happiness of your birthday seemed to fast forward us through the day.  I have a feeling that before we know it, you&#8217;re going to be outgrowing your clothes, asking for money, and sneaking out at night.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to play catch with you.  I can&#8217;t wait to show you how to change the brakes on your first car.  I can&#8217;t wait to teach you how to shave&#8230;</p>
<p>But at the same time, I don&#8217;t want to wish this time away.  Take your time growing up little man, we&#8217;ve got all the time in the world &#8211; and we&#8217;re just getting started.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Today we had our next check-up appointment.  We&#8217;re at the point where we go every two weeks, so time is really starting to fly. When the Dr. came in he asked Eric and I &#8221; How are the two and a half of you doing?&#8221;  Then as we talked, we realized it&#8217;s more like two and three-quarters, of us since Baby Van is a few days from being 32 weeks old. If I go full term that only leaves us 8 more weeks!!</p>
<p>Things are slowly progressing in the baby room. At this point, we&#8217;re just waiting for the carpeting to come in and get installed so we can get the paint up, and get furniture moved into the room. I&#8217;m really hoping that the carpeting being here &#8220;within three weeks&#8221; ends up being less than two so that we can get moving. Although we still have a month before we hit that 36 week point, at which Baby Van would be okay entering the world, I&#8217;m getting nervous that we&#8217;re going to be scrambling. My goal is to have everything set in the room by March 31st. Somehow I think that date will be here before we know it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to start putting stuff in the room and seeing it all come together. We&#8217;ve got lots of things to start putting away, thanks to all our great friends and family who have helped stock us with all kinds of fun baby stuff &#8211; right now the basement looks like Babies R Us has moved in. It really makes Eric and I appreciate how many people care about us 🙂</p>
<p>Not much else to update right now &#8211; for those who are keeping track, the heartbeat today was right around 140.  We&#8217;ve mostly been in the 150s, with one other time where it was 136. So, basically Baby Van likes to keep us all guessing.</p>
<p>And finally, some more baby bump photos &#8211; the little guy/gal had definitely expanded his or her living quarters!<a href="http://www.ericvb.com/family/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/portrait32_weeks.jpg"><br />

					<p>If so, that must be what&#8217;s going on.  🙂</p>
<p>I am definitely now feeling movement &#8211; not so much jabs at this point, as it is rolling and turning.  And so far, it seems as though Baby Van is more of a night owl, usually starting up around 5:00pm and continuing into the evening.  It&#8217;s pretty cool to feel the movement, but also a little strange. All this time we&#8217;ve known there was a baby in there, and the ultrasound further confirmed that, but with the movement it&#8217;s a new level of awareness. I know Eric is looking forward to the time when he can feel something too &#8211; although that means I&#8217;m getting jabbed hard enough for an outside person to notice &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m looking forward to that or not!</p>
<p>In general, things seem to be plugging away just fine, and the weeks seem to be flying by. We both realize that we will need to kick into gear after the holidays and start getting our house (and ourselves) baby ready. Slowly the extra room is getting cleaned out and soon will be revamped into a nursery. We&#8217;re coming to terms that we need to tackle picking out baby furniture, and more importantly, entering the wide-world of Babies &#8216;R Us. If you want to feel overwhelmed, just walk into the bottle aisle &#8211; then as you&#8217;re running the other way, you get lost in the jumpy seat aisle, and turned around in the diaper aisle.  Soon the place has you trapped, and the only way out seems to be to register for everything &#8220;just in case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, maybe it&#8217;s not that bad, but we both have realized there&#8217;s a lot to do, and that we should probably get ourselves moving sooner than later. So come January, we&#8217;re all engines ready to go.</p>
<p>So keep checking back, as we have many  more updates to come &#8211; and as we get the nursery piece started we&#8217;ll put up some photos.</p>
