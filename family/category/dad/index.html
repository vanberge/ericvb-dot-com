				<small>Monday, July 30th, 2018</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>To start this story, I need to tell a little bit about myself.</p>
<p>One of my main personality profile traits is a fear of failure.  It&#8217;s come up on a couple different personality tests from a couple different places I have worked.  This trait has its pros and cons with my career in IT &#8211; where I tend to test things very thoroughly and overall try to be risk averse. This ultimately helps our customers have less downtime &#8211; so to some degree that can be a pro. One of the cons of it, however, means that if I&#8217;m unsure about something I may tend to set it on the backburner and procrastinate it.</p>
<p>A very specific example of this is taking certification tests for IT related technologies. Throughout my career, I&#8217;ve been to training for many enterprise level things: Cisco networking, VMware, various Linux/Unix, Microsoft Server, etc &#8211; the list goes on and on. But I had <em>never</em> taken a test after these trainings to get certified.  I would tell myself &#8220;oh my employers don&#8217;t care about the certification, just the knowledge that comes with the training&#8221;  but if I am being honest with myself, I avoided the tests because I was scared I&#8217;d fail. I would feel humiliated, disappointed in myself, and that fear of failure made it too easy for me to avoid facing a test.  I&#8217;d think about this every year or so, and have this twinge of guilt and remorse; a dark spot on my IT career that I would try not to think about.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2018 and Chase being 8 years old.  The cub scouts are having a late nighter at the YMCA which has a couple hours budgeted for swimming.  In order to be able to swim the full range of the pool and not be confined to the kiddie section, swimmers have to take a &#8220;test&#8221; to demonstrate their swimming ability to a life guard on staff.  The test consisted of treading water for 60 seconds, and then swimming the length of the pool without touching bottom or stopping.  I knew without a doubt that Chase could do this after swimming for a couple summers at Grandma&#8217;s house &#8211; but he was less sure of himself.  He didn&#8217;t want to take the test, and he was telling me (and himself) he was going to be <em>fine</em> in the shallow end of the pool.  As I started to talk him through it, at some point my words of advice to him became my own advice as well.  &#8220;I know you can pass &#8211; but even if you don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s ok!  Try your best and see what happens.  Even if you do fail, we&#8217;ll practice and try again&#8221;.  Even after a few rounds of this, he remained hesitant and was going to settle for the shallow end.  I didnt want that for him.  I dont want him to settle.  But, that meant I couldn&#8217;t settle for the figurative shallow end either&#8230;</p>
<p>I finally said &#8220;you know what &#8211; I know exactly how you feel.  I&#8217;m scared to take tests too.  I never take them when I should at work because I worry I wont pass&#8221;.</p>
<p>It was now clear that Chase has this same personality trait, so it was time for us both to get over this hump together.   I proposed a deal:  If he would try the swim test at the YMCA, I would register for an exam on the latest training I had gone through &#8211; Microsoft&#8217;s Cloud.  Once he had me willing to take the plunge with him (puns, puns everywhere), Chase summoned up the courage to try the swim test that night at the YMCA.  Of course the kid passed.  He treaded water without an issue, and swam his best to get to the end of the pool with an excited grin on his face.  I congratulated him, telling him I knew he could do it.  Now with his part completed, I was committed.  Even if I had to admit to my son that I failed my part, I had made a promise and there was no backing out now.  I went ahead and scheduled my exam for implementing Microsoft cloud solutions.</p>
<p>I took it seriously.  I did some practice tests, hands on labs, and even studying my practice exams while coming back from a road trip to Mackinac island.  I felt prepared, but I was still very nervous when it came to test time.  The proctors of these exams take it even more seriously.  You&#8217;re monitored on video, and they take all your belongings off your person before you&#8217;re allowed to start the test.  You get a notepad and writing utensil for notes&#8230;  That&#8217;s it.   I honed my concentration as much as possible and tried to remember my own advice &#8211; &#8220;It&#8217;s ok if you fail &#8211; but try your best&#8221;.  About an hour later, I was done.  Before I was even ready to see my score, the electronic system thrusts it at me.  <strong>861/1000 &#8211; RESULT: PASS</strong>.   I was more happy and excited than Chase had been when he&#8217;d passed his respective test, for sure.  Although, I guess mine has been over ten years in the making here.  And even better for me was how awesome it felt to tell the kid that ended up being <em>MY</em> inspiration that neither of us were settling for the shallow end&#8230;</p>

					<p>Any father/son relationship is going to have what I&#8217;m going to refer to as &#8220;gaps&#8221;.  And, what I mean when I say this I guess is something like a generational divide.  Music, media, technology &#8211; the entire world really, all change at a rapid pace.  So, for me it&#8217;s easy to understand how a father might have difficulty relating to a child.  A father could easily have no idea how to get a new computer game set up.  A father could want his son to play baseball when the boy wants only to skateboard.  etc etc, you get my drift.  Granted, most of my experience in this area comes from the son&#8217;s perspective.  I&#8217;ve been a son for almost 34 years, but a father only 4.  Being a father now and having it pretty easy gives me a full appreciation what my father had to do and how great a job he did to relate to his boys.</p>
<p>Computers as we know them didn&#8217;t exist when I was born.  Video games didn&#8217;t exist when I was born. But things changed quickly as I grew. Bugs bunny surrendered the crown of the cartoon realm to He-Man, Lion-O, and some humanoid amphibians that could do karate. Playing with cap guns outside yielded, at least in part, to the Nintendo Zapper.  I could go on forever with examples, my point is the world changed so quickly during my lifetime that I can only imagine what it felt like to try and keep up.  In a lot of ways, my brother and got to maybe learn along <em>with</em> my father.  I&#8217;m sure in fact that I owe my career to one of these areas in particular:  Him tirelessly experimenting with our computers to keep up with the relentless demand of his greedy sons and their countless computer games.  Sitting alongside him as he had to hack and tweak computers to run our games fostered a curiosity of my own with computers.  It&#8217;s amazing to me to think that a career in Healthcare I.T. started this way, but it truly did. </p>
<p>Compared to my father, I have it pretty easy.  There are hardly any gaps for me to close.  At least, for now&#8230; The Ninja Turtles still have their place in the animated world and Mario and Luigi are still trying to figure out why Princess Peach doesn&#8217;t have a restraining order against Bowser.  If Chase (or Carter in the future) have trouble with a tough level of a video game, the chances are pretty good that I can help them without a great deal of effort.  If they want to skate board instead of play baseball I&#8217;ll be able to show them how to do an ollie and a shady shuvit.  But, at the same time, I haven&#8217;t lost the &#8220;old school&#8221; pieces.  I feel incredibly equipped and confident helping my boys with whatever life might throw at them, and whatever they might throw at me; whether it be old school or new.  This is a direct result of my father working so hard to fight these gaps that grew so quickly for him.  For that, I am immensely grateful.  </p>
<p>Who knows, much of this might change as our lives continue.  If the gaps begin to grow, I know exactly what I have to do. Somebody has already shown me. </p>
<p>This blog post would probably be very different if we had girls though.</p>

					<p>As Carter aged closer to the 12 week mark, I started thinking about how the transition to daycare would impact us as a family. This is certainly the toughest part in the early stages of a kid&#8217;s life &#8211; even if only from the perspective of the parent. On one hand, families must work to provide income which pays for a home, food, and clothing; while on the other it can be difficult to think about being away from your kids for so long at a time. The baby probably doesn&#8217;t even notice a difference, but Mom and Dad can sometimes feel a sense of guilt.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found that the right daycare helps this immensely. We have found one that we feel very comfortable with, have gotten to know the staff, and overall view it as a very positive experience vs a negative one. This trend should definitely continue now that we&#8217;re throwing a 2nd kid their way, even if it may not feel like it initially.</p>
<p>Even though I told myself this repeatedly and continued to reassure myself, I decided to take a &#8220;Dad week&#8221; and postpone Carter&#8217;s daycare start date. So I put in for some PTO and am playing &#8220;Stay at home dad&#8221; this week. Even though I&#8217;m only on the 2nd day of this, I&#8217;m already very glad I did it. These first 3 months are just a total blur. Visiting alot of people, people visiting us, making sure to help Chase understand and learn the transition, and really just the family life in general. During that time, Carter has definitely developed a special bond with his mom. I struggle to soothe him repeatedly only to see her calm him instantly. At times it can feel frustrating, but then I think to myself I&#8217;m glad that he has that bond with her now. My time will come when it&#8217;s time to drive a stick shift, or to throw a curve ball. So it&#8217;s fine that Mom&#8217;s time to shine is now. But even with that said, my goal with this week was to slow things down a bit and enjoy just being a dad.</p>
<p>Armed with some tips, tricks, and a schedule for eating and napping &#8211; I&#8217;m going to make the most of this week and enjoy focusing on being Carter&#8217;s dad. Whether he likes it or not! 🙂</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>It&#8217;s the most cliche statement in the entire universe: &#8220;Time flies&#8221; &#8212; You hear every parent say that about every kid that has ever existed. And you know what? It&#8217;s 100% true.</p>
<p>Being a father is like this crazy catch 22. I can&#8217;t believe Chase is over 3 years old. But at the same time, I can&#8217;t believe pictures of him when he was an infant; that he was ever that small.  I don&#8217;t want him to grow up, yet I look forward to playing catch, teaching him to drive, and watching him become a man.  I don&#8217;t want to waste every minute worrying about getting out a camera instead of enjoying precious moments, but I want to remember every single thing.  I worry about having to share the amazing bond I have with him when his future brother/sister comes, but I want him to know what it is to be a big brother and to have the opportunity for the friendship like I have with my brother.</p>
<p>I think it comes down to the realization that I&#8217;ll never get enough of this.  Chase&#8217;s childhood.  Being a dad with him at this age.  No matter how much time I spend doing anything with him, it will never be enough.  I&#8217;ll still miss it when it&#8217;s over, even if I was sick of it while it was happening (&#8220;Oh my gosh you seriously want to read the &#8216;scary&#8217; troll book AGAIN!?&#8221;).  So, I can&#8217;t worry about it.  I just need to enjoy it while it lasts, and balance it as much as possible with the rest of the filler that fills in the gaps of life.</p>
<p>Some fun brainstorming bullets that I don&#8217;t want to forget</p>
<ul>
<li>You always say &#8220;oot&#8221; (Like foot without the f) instead of &#8220;ate&#8221;.  &#8220;I oot it all gone!&#8221;</li>
<li>The term &#8220;last night&#8221; means anything that ever happened in the past.  Yes, you did have a birthday last night &#8212; like 3 months ago.</li>
<li>You always want to take the highway when we drive somewhere.  You know the terms M6 and 131, but you mix them up depending on if we are going to/from home.  You correct me when I correct you.  &#8220;No this is M6&#8243;&#8230;.</li>
<li>You like to tackle me at a full sprint, mom does not like this so much.</li>
<li>You mix up syllables in &#8220;forgot&#8221;; &#8220;Daddy, we &#8216;got for&#8217; Buzz light year at home!&#8221;</li>
<li>Your old bike is too small but you don&#8217;t really like your new bike yet because you can&#8217;t pedal it backwards, as those are brakes now instead of reverse</li>
<li>You tripped over your stool today in the bathroom and bumped your chin on the toilet.  You insisted on a Lightning Mcqueen bandaid that looked like a football chinstrap on you.</li>
<li>You like the Deftones. Specifically &#8220;Entombed&#8221; and &#8220;What happened to you&#8221;</li>
<li> Just this last month or so was your first time on a go-cart.  I crashed into walls lightly on purpose because everyone was so far ahead of us.</li>
<li>We play soccer and baseball outside.  Regarding baseball, you reverse your hands on the bat but you make good contact.  You  say &#8220;home run&#8221; after the smallest hit and run wildly around the yard as if you&#8217;re running bases.  With soccer, you mostly try to keep the ball away from me by turtling over it.  You like to be goalie but you just stand there while I score on you.</li>
<li>.. I&#8217;m going to keep adding to this as I think of more&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The balancing act continues&#8230;  We&#8217;re just stacking some stuff up a little higher to make it more interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>I didn&#8217;t think too much of this as it happened, but it&#8217;s stuck with me throughout the evening and I want to write it out while it&#8217;s fresh so I don&#8217;t forget it.</p>
<p>We took Chase shopping to pick up some odds and ends at Meijer tonight. It was a pretty standard trip.  We picked up some food, some random stuff, we ran up and down aisles, we looked at fish, and we checked out Sandy the 1 cent pony as we paid for our items.  Walking through the parking lot, it was starting to get dark, and the sunset was giving a reddish orange tone to some clouds rolling in that may have been a rain storm; but it was hard to tell.  </p>
<p>Chase is always looking up and checking out clouds, stars, airplanes, birds, you name it&#8230;</p>
<p>Tonight he looks up as I carried him to our car, and he said &#8220;Moon!&#8221;&#8230;  Sure enough, there was a half moon poking through some clouds.  I asked him &#8220;where is it?&#8221; acting like I didn&#8217;t see it, so he pointed it out to me and said &#8220;BIG!&#8221;</p>
<p>I acknowledged, &#8220;yeah, that is a big moon!&#8230;&#8221;  And then I asked him: &#8220;Do you think you can reach it?&#8221;  Without any hesitation, without any thought of failing, he pushed up on my shoulders, tried to climb with his feet against my chest, and he reached his hand as high as he possibly could.</p>
<p>I let him try for a bit as Chris put the grocery cart away, and he kept at it while saying &#8220;high!&#8221; and &#8220;reach it?!&#8221;  It was somehow profound in an intensely subtle way.  Even now I can&#8217;t help but smile thinking it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll try again kiddo, maybe you&#8217;ll get it next time.</p>

					<p>Chase is give or take 1.5 years old nowadays.  With that, I wanted to take a quick opportunity to share some of the videos we&#8217;ve gotten uploaded recently!  If you&#8217;ve already seen these on Facebook; just disregard.  </p>

					<p>Holy smokes!</p>
<p>The last few months with Chase have flown by like nothing I can even compare to.  We plowed through his first set of Thanksgiving and Christmas, and it was really nice.</p>
<p>Chase got to spend alot of time with both families throughout the holidays; and he certainly got his fair share of toys and clothes across the board.  There are all kinds of pictures and videos we need to get to work on posting.  It&#8217;s much harder than either of us expected to keep up with the world of a baby.  Between Chase, work, family, friends, and life in general &#8211; there really is not a surplus of free time.</p>
<p>This has been one of the harder areas for me to adjust.  My multitasking has had to improve and I&#8217;ve had to prioritize alot of the things in my life.  Netflix movies now sit for months on end without being watched.  My Xbox gets turned on once or twice a month vs DAILY.  My DVR just keeps accumulating unwatched TV.  This has been a natural change, and been something I&#8217;ve been happy with.  I still try to work in a gaming session and stay up late watching some TV every now and again; but certainly the primary focus of my time and effort is Chase.</p>
<p>The fast pace of the last few months are met only by how quick Chase has begun to change.  It seemed like he began scooting and crawling overnight.  His teeth have appeared out of nowhere.  He is able to hit his xylephone toy in a semi realistic play fashion.  He is really developing quickly and it&#8217;s really fun to see his personality come out.</p>
<p>There is a downside lately, and the poor kid has just been through the ringer as far as being sick.  What started as a fever became diarrhea, then he had a dual ear infection, then he had a sinus infection, then developed a harsh cough for over a month, and finally he has gotten pink-eye.  So hopefully his immune system has seen enough for this winter season and he can start feeling better.</p>
<p>The family life has become routine and we&#8217;re in a good rhythm.  Chase is getting the hang of being a kid while mom/dad are getting the hang of being parents.  So now that things are all hitting their stride, it&#8217;s time to catch up on documenting all the fun we&#8217;re having!  Blogging/pics/vids to come!</p>

					<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; </p>
<p>That&#8217;s about the best word we can think to describe the last 6 months&#8230;  Chase is just about 6 months old, and it seems like it&#8217;s literally happened overnight.</p>
<p>Days fly by, hours turn seem to go in seconds, and weeks melt together months at a time.  In this short time it has been amazing the way so many different things have come together.  We&#8217;ve had amazing help from friends, the grandparents, and other family in all kinds of different ways.  We&#8217;re so thankful for all the people that surround this family.  For Mom and Dad (just now starting to get used to that!) &#8211;  We&#8217;ve figured out a great pattern in our life.  Mom has a new part time job that works perfectly from a scheduling perspective.  She gets to have her foot in the door as well as spend a great deal of time raising Chase.  We&#8217;ve had to make adjustments along the way with who&#8217;s watching him, when, and how we handle things.  But, everything IS working out very well and we are in a great spot.</p>
<p>As for Chase, he&#8217;s at a really fun age for us.  He&#8217;s gotten very good with his hands; grabbing, reaching and getting a feel for the world.  He&#8217;s also gotten to the point where he can sit by himself for short amounts of time, roll over pretty consistently, and there are even some glimpses of crawling motions in the works (though he still has a way to go; you can tell he&#8217;s trying).  His motor skills seemed to begin appearing out of nowhere and have really developed rapidly.  It&#8217;s been really amazing to see and be a part of.</p>
<p>Of course, with all this adjustment, planning, adapting, and recalibrating of our lives it has been immensely difficult to keep up with the things we should really be focusing on: sharing pictures, videos, and posting about this little guy.  Well, today marks a shift of focus where we make time to organize our hundreds of photos, videos, and share our thoughts and activities that we have going on.  More info to come!</p>

					<p>Now we&#8217;re just about 2 months into this journey with young Chase, and it&#8217;s had both ups and downs.</p>
<p>On the upside, our little man has begun to be quite social.  He frequently communicates with various forms of &#8220;Ooohh&#8221; and &#8220;Cooooh&#8221; and even a pretty good amount of smiling.  We&#8217;ve begun to get a feel for patterns (just as he decides they need to change), and we&#8217;ve even gotten a pretty good hang of the child-rearin&#8217; basics.  It doesn&#8217;t take long to be a professional diaper changer.</p>
<p>Really the only downside, if you can call it that; has been a bit of a struggle for us to figure out a pattern that works for us as a family.  We&#8217;ve tried to manage keeping Chase knowing the difference between night and day, while making sure he gets enough to eat, while making sure that we get a semi-functional amount of sleep.  So, there&#8217;s been some stress and sleep deprivation associated with that.  But, we&#8217;re getting it all figured out &#8211; and by no means do these outweigh the strong upside of this little guy joining our family.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had a pretty busy few weeks lately.  From a baby shower with family/friends up north, to a nice holiday weekend, and even a weekend visiting grandma and grandpa down south.  All this and the summer is just getting started!  🙂  The shower was really nice, Grandma and Grandpa VB always know how to hold a nice get together with great family, friends, and great food!  It gave Chase a chance to meet most of the family on his dad&#8217;s side, and everyone had a really nice time.</p>
<p>Another thing lately is that Chase has become much more social, we&#8217;ve tried to take pictures and capture some videos showing these moments as you can see below&#8230;  </p>
<p>This video cracks me up &#8211; Leaving a present for mom and dad.  Very audibly&#8230;!<br />
<object width="500" height="324"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/22cKDgmdHLU&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/22cKDgmdHLU&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="500" height="324"></embed></object></p>
<p>And, a couple fun pics showing off his happier side.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who&#8217;s helped us out over the last few weeks!  It&#8217;s been great to have so many people that can give us a hand in so many different areas.  We appreciate it all!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Welcome to the world, little man&#8230;</p>
<p>Your name is Chase Michael VanBergen.  You were born at 9:33pm on April 14th.  You weighed 7 pounds, 7 ounces when you were born, and you were 20 inches long.</p>
<p>Your mom and I were so happy to finally meet you!  Once we saw you were a boy, we agreed right away on your name.  &#8220;Chase&#8221; seemed to really fit you for some reason, so hopefully you like it as much as we do.  You share your middle name &#8220;Michael&#8221; with your father, and it&#8217;s also your Grandfather&#8217;s first name.  I am proud to share that with you, and I know your Grandpa is as well.</p>
<p>Your Mother seemed to always know you were going to be a boy, and really that&#8217;s where the odds pointed.  I, on the other hand, seemed to guess against the odds thinking you were going to be a girl&#8230;  But I&#8217;m very glad that you turned out to be exactly who you are.  You have changed our lives forever for the better, and we&#8217;re both looking forward to growing as parents, learning along the way, and helping you become the best little man you can be.</p>
<p>This picture of you was taken just minutes after you were born.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/family/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/DSCF1018-e1271504225973.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-117" title="Baby Chase" src="http://www.ericvb.com/family/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/DSCF1018-e1271504327467.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;re here, we&#8217;ve been working on dropping the &#8220;Baby Van&#8221; label that you were given early on&#8230;  In a way, it was like a name for you before you were born.  I&#8217;m using &#8220;Baby Chase&#8221; to help me transition &#8211; because I still have a tendency to say Baby Van.</p>
<p>This experience has been amazing, but I can see how parents look back and say &#8220;it all happened so fast&#8221; &#8211; because it really has.  The 9 months of pregnancy seems to have just flown by&#8230;  and even though your Mom went through a 19 hour labor with you, the anticipation and happiness of your birthday seemed to fast forward us through the day.  I have a feeling that before we know it, you&#8217;re going to be outgrowing your clothes, asking for money, and sneaking out at night.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to play catch with you.  I can&#8217;t wait to show you how to change the brakes on your first car.  I can&#8217;t wait to teach you how to shave&#8230;</p>
<p>But at the same time, I don&#8217;t want to wish this time away.  Take your time growing up little man, we&#8217;ve got all the time in the world &#8211; and we&#8217;re just getting started.</p>
