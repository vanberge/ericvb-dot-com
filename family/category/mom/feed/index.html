										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone told me that when you have kids the days may seem to go slow but the years fly by. I didnâ€™t realize how true this is until I was sitting in Chaseâ€™s room looking at a whiteboard where we wrote his feeding times when he was first born. A year ago we were still getting up at 4:00am to feed him â€“ and now we have a little man on our hands. Even through the sleep deprivation, we somehow managed to successfully make it through the first year. Although we have not successfully kept up with our website updates J</p>
<p>A lot has happened recently, so Iâ€™ll do my best to do a rundown of events.</p>
<p><strong><em>First Birthday Party</em></strong> â€“ in April we had a firetruck-themed birthday party for Chase. We had lots of family and friends that helped us celebrate the day. Chase would have been happy with just balloons â€“ he had no interest in smooshing his cake or opening presents â€“ he just liked running around the room until he was pooped out. But, the party was fun and we are grateful for all the love he was shown.</p>
<p><strong><em>Walking &#8211; </em></strong> On a spur of the moment one Wednesday evening, Chase decided it was time to walk. Either we donâ€™t do things fast enough for him, or he was so set on running after Molly, he went for it. Neither Eric or I were prepared for it so it was a huge surprise. Once he figured it out, it didnâ€™t take long for him to master it. Now poor Kitt and Molly have discovered they have to move much faster to get out of his way. And poor Mom and Dad have discovered how much stuff has to be moved to higher ground. So far the only major catastrophe was a cup of coffee that got spilled on the new carpet â€“ we learned very quickly after that!</p>
<p><strong><em>Ears </em></strong>â€“ Seems like this has been a common theme at our house. After a round of ear infections in December, we thought we had things under control. But in April we got hit with them again â€“ this time we went through 5 rounds of antibiotics. After the last round was finished, and after a slight run in with a double-dose of very strong antibiotics (talk about freaked out parents!), we decided that ear tubes were the way to go. Although it was tough to know he was going to be on anesthesia, knowing that this would help eliminate the infections was a huge plus. It was a little comical to watch his reaction after he was given the first dose of meds to calm him down (he acted spacey like I would after a night out on the town), and overall the surgery went well. So, now we play the waiting game and hope we donâ€™t have any more ear issues.</p>
<p><strong><em>Parentâ€™s Vacation Away</em></strong> â€“ Just this past week, Eric and I took our first long vacation since having Chase. We left him with Grandma and Grandpa V. Knowing he was in good hands made it easy to relax, but it was still an odd feeling to not be chasing him around. Eric and I had a great time with a group of friends down on a houseboat in Tennessee, and only called home twice in the 6 days we were away from Chase. It was a little heartbreaking when Chase came home on Sunday and was less than enthused to see either of us. Apparently, time at Grandma and Grandpaâ€™s was way more fun â€“ I think he was ready to go back with them!</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, this has been an amazing year all around. We have gotten to watch Chase grow from a newborn, to a baby, to an infant, and now into a very inquisitive toddler. We have also learned a heck of a lot about being parents. Even with stumbles along the way, I think we have fared pretty well. With Chase walking and the nice weather finally here, we are all getting to enjoy time outside â€“ so as long as our stumbles donâ€™t result in skinned knees, Iâ€™m happy!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One month ago at this time, the first signs (ie. contractions) of Chase entering the world began. It seems like just yesterday that we were anxiously awaiting his birth, and yet at the same time it seems so long ago.Â  Yet, here I sit on May 9th in absolute awe that I am now a part of the &#8220;mom&#8221; group being honored on this day. Even though I know I am a mom, it is still overwhelming for me to realize that I have a son &#8211; a son who I will shape and watch grow for the rest of my life. There is nothing that I am more thankful for than this little guy sleeping in my arms <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The first few weeks have been a whirlwind of activity/emotions/diaper changes/etc. No matter how many people you talk to or books you read, nobody can truly prepare you for what parenthood brings. It is the most wonderful thing in world and also the hardest thing I&#8217;ve ever done. Each day you hope that you do everything just right to ensure that your child thrives as best as possible and that you don&#8217;t do anything that will impact them 20 years down the road. Did I feed them enough? Did I feed them too much? Why is he making that noise? Why isn&#8217;t he making any noise?Â  Is that smell coming from my little guy?Â  How in the world did my kid create that smell?</p>
<p>For me this time has been enjoyable, but also a big adjustment. I&#8217;m such a schedule/task oriented person that Chase is slowly teaching me how to go with the flow and that no matter how much you prepare or plan, you have to be flexible and go with whatever schedule he needs right now. As his dad can attest &#8211; getting me to change is not an easy task!Â  But slowly, I am learning that it&#8217;s okay to just sit back, relax, and enjoy watching &#8220;Let&#8217;s Make A Deal&#8221; everyday at 10:00am. And that if the dishes aren&#8217;t done or the laundry piles up, nobody is going to worry about it. All that matters right now is that Chase is happy, healthy, and thriving.Â  And he is all of those for sure.</p>
<p>At his two week appointment, he had already gained back the weight he lost the first week and then some, and now two weeks later, he&#8217;s still growing like a weed. He no longer fits in his newborn onesies, and is getting stronger by the day it seems. He loves to lift his head, look around, and is starting to notice his hands. He has his own little noises (and yes, he does snore like dad) and even though we haven&#8217;t gotten a real smile yet, the gas smiles are still worth it.</p>
<p>He has gotten to meet much of his family and has spent weekends at both grandparent&#8217;s houses. The best part about a new baby is that everything becomes their first.Â  Their first trip to the grocery store, the first bath, and today, his first trip to a Chinese restaurant. This of course included his first fortune from his first fortune cookie &#8211; &#8220;You will run into an old friend soon.&#8221;Â  With less than a full month under his belt, I&#8217;m not sure what old friends he has, but I guess we&#8217;ll see them soon!</p>
<p>This month would have not been as enjoyable or manageable without the support of all of our friends and family who have provided support, advice, and great food &#8211; so I need to send a huge THANK YOU to everybody who has been there for us. It makes both Eric and I feel so grateful to have so many people who care about us, and now Chase too. And a very special thank you to both grandma&#8217;s who are celebrating their first grandmother&#8217;s day!</p>
<p>I could go on and on (and on and on) about all that&#8217;s happened in the past few weeks, but I think the following photos are a way to sum them up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Car seat installed.  Check.<br />
Baby room finished.  Check.<br />
Bottles and clothes washed.  Check.<br />
Hospital bags packed.  Check.</p>
<p>With two weeks to go, we&#8217;re actually feeling pretty prepared for Baby Van&#8217;s arrival. I&#8217;m sure the minute we have to head to the hospital the feeling of preparation will go out the window about as fast as we drive, but in the meantime we&#8217;re just trying to enjoy the feeling.  It&#8217;s crazy to think that it&#8217;s been 9 months since we found out our family was going to grow, and yet at the same time, it seems like just yesterday.</p>
<p>We have been having weekly appointments now, so we get to hear the heartbeat pretty regularly (still right around 140/145). And since I have a cold, I ended up having an extra appointment in there too. So far things are still right on track &#8211; we&#8217;re just waiting for the first official sign that Baby Van is ready to enter the world. I have not had any contractions or other signs yet, so I think our little guy/gal is just content hanging out for now. I&#8217;m glad things are going smoothly, but am starting to get anxious to meet our newest addition. And, now that we&#8217;re counting down the time in days instead of weeks, it&#8217;s only added to that feeling. At our last appointment they did confirm that they don&#8217;t like to have women go more than 7-10 days past their due date so we&#8217;ll have an April baby no matter what.  Eric thinks it will be on the 16th, I was thinking the 17th &#8211; but unfortunately it&#8217;s not up to us <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Most of our time has been spent putting the finishing touches on everything. We spent time getting the car seat all set up in my car so that we aren&#8217;t trying to do that in the midst of heading to the hospital (which is a good thing, as it took us a little while to get it just right). I&#8217;ve been sorting and washing clothes and bottles so things are set when we come home. The bassinet is set up, and has yet to be discovered by the cat, so that should be ready for our first night at home. Probably the biggest piece was just finishing up the room. Since the last post we got our glider/ottoman and finally got the picture frame border up. Overall I&#8217;m really happy with how it all turned out &#8211; it was fun to be able to take a room from plain to something fun and kid-like. And because most of the concept were things we did ourselves (from finding the fabric for the windows to painting/finding the photos for the frames) it makes me that much more proud.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to think this will be our last post, but there&#8217;s a good chance we&#8217;ll have another one before the big day &#8211; especially if Baby Van holds out for a late April birthday!  And for anybody who is inclined to comment, we&#8217;d love to get your thoughts on whether the baby is a girl or a boy and what date you think they&#8217;ll make their debut.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have officially moved into our &#8220;third trimester&#8221; which means we are getting closer to the debut of Baby Van. In the meantime, the mom- and dad-to-be are starting to pull things together to change what was the official junk room into a cute, inviting, and oh yeah &#8211; safe &#8211; place for the newest addition to reside.</p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d take this chance to post a few images (some that are stock, some that are ours) of the things we have for the room so far. We went this week and made a decision on the paint color (Tiggers Tummy to be exact &#8211; a light, but bright yellow) and carpeting for the room. Now it&#8217;s just a matter of pulling it all together.</p>
<p>Also, we get to have another glimpse at the actual Baby Van this coming Wednesday. At my last appointment the doctor felt it would be a good idea to have another ultrasound since I&#8217;m measuring a little small for how far along I am. She seemed to think everything is fine, but they just want to take measurements of the baby to be sure. Both Eric and I are excited for the chance to see our little guy/gal on the ultrasound again, but also want to ensure everything is okay. Eric&#8217;s hoping to be able to take a video when we go, so we&#8217;ll try to post that. If anything, we should have some photos at least. And, for those who are wondering (the grandma&#8217;s especially :)), we are still not planning to find out the sex.Â  And no, we won&#8217;t have them just tell you.Â  So, look for that post later this week.</p>
<p>Onward to the fun stuff&#8230;images are below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All kinds of changes going on it seems in lots of ways:</p>
<p>First, and most obvious &#8211; it&#8217;s a new year. Since we found out we were expecting last August, it&#8217;s always been &#8220;We&#8217;re due April of next year.&#8221;Â  Suddenly we&#8217;ve realized that we can&#8217;t say that anymore &#8211; it&#8217;s April of this year!Â  For whatever reason, that small change has had a big impact and has found us spending our weekends working at getting our house in order, picking out furniture, etc.Â  All the things that we felt like we had plenty of time to do are now having to actually become priorities. The start of 2010 has been a good kick in the pants to get moving &#8211; especially with the realization that we are getting close to the three months left mark!</p>
<p>Second &#8211; we now officially have a changing table in the soon-to-be Baby Van&#8217;s room. Late December we found a good deal on a crib and dresser set that I put on layway (since we aren&#8217;t quite prepared for all the furniture) and then also found the glider/recliner we liked, which is also kindly being stored at Babies R Us for now. We decided that we wanted to have an actual changing table since the dresser is pretty small and were lucky enough to find a floor sample that was a good match for the crib/dresser. Of course, we had to take it that day so we have our first real piece of baby furniture. Having that in the room has made the transition even more real &#8211; especially for the cat who is having a hard time figuring out what&#8217;s happening to what has always been her room <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Â  We&#8217;ve been working hard to clean the room out to get it ready for new carpeting/paint/etc. As we get things further along we&#8217;ll post some photos.</p>
<p>Third major change &#8211; and the one that&#8217;s been the most fun &#8211; is that Baby Van has apparently found out how to effectively use his/her arms and legs. No longer am I just feeling the little flutters here and there. Now I&#8217;m getting jabbed and punched pretty frequently, to the point that I can sit and watch my stomach move around. It really is pretty mesmerizing to watch &#8211; I find myself sitting around the house with my shirt pulled up so I can see all the movement. Eric has been able to feel the movement a lot more now too, which I think has been pretty cool for him. And today Molly was laying by me with her head on my belly and I was just waiting for her to get her first inkling of Baby Van.Â  I&#8217;m sure that will come soon enough! I know for some, they&#8217;d prefer to not have people touching their bellies &#8211; but since it&#8217;s all so new to me I want to have everybody feel the movement. Baby Van might be a little shy, because it seems like the movement stops whenever I try to share it with someone, but I&#8217;m sure there will be enough to go around in the next three months.</p>
<p>Finally &#8211; in addition to Baby Van&#8217;s changing &#8211; I&#8217;m seeing my physical changes. I had to officially move into maternity pants (which really are some of the most comfortable pants to wear, although not the most flattering) as my regular pants were past the point of being buttoned or zipped. Although Baby Van seems to be tucked away in my torso, I finally have a baby bump, which I am thankful for, as it gives some validity to the &#8220;I&#8217;m due in April&#8221; statement. And to go along with that, we&#8217;ve started the photos &#8211; I&#8217;ve posted two for your enjoyment <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/family/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSCF1006-e1263787347949.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-45" title="The Official &quot;Baby Bump&quot;" src="http://www.ericvb.com/family/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSCF1006-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/family/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSCF1007-e1263787379207.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-46" title="Baby Bump 2" src="http://www.ericvb.com/family/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSCF1007-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>With all the things that are starting to come together, and with us getting closer and closer to Baby Van&#8217;s official birthdate, we hope to post more frequently, especially as we get the room started/finished. Our next doctor&#8217;s appointment is in just over a week so we&#8217;ll share more info then as well. Lots of changes so far, and many more to come &#8211; but all have been exciting!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, so maybe the second part isn&#8217;t quite relevant, but how do you start that song lyric and not finish it?</p>
<p>Officially this week we are half way.Â  20 weeks down, 20 to go.Â  The past few weeks have shown great improvement in the sense that food is once again my friend, and all the things I like to eat are sounding appetizing again. Hence, I have had Mexican food any chance I get. However, after our appointment yesterday, I found out I am not gaining as much as I should be at this point, so I&#8217;m now making it a point to eat more ice cream in there too.Â  I read on a website that&#8217;s a good way to gain weight, and I&#8217;m not going to argue with anybody who tells me to eat ice cream every day <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>It was amazing to have the ultrasound and see little Van moving around. It&#8217;s crazy to actually see a living thing moving inside you. I think both Eric and I were just kind of in awe for the whole appointment.Â  Unfortunately, the little guy/gal wasn&#8217;t cooperating and kept his/her arm up by its head the whole time blocking it&#8217;s little face (or as russelltee said, doing the sprinkler dance).Â  So, you&#8217;ll see that in a lot of the photos. Otherwise we got a good view of the baby and from what we saw and they said, all is well.Â  Here&#8217;s the stats:</p>
<p>1.First &#8211; no, we did not change our minds and find out the sex. Eric has his suspicion that it&#8217;s a girl, I think it&#8217;s a boy &#8211; so even after the appointment we have not a clue. Let&#8217;s just say there wasn&#8217;t anything that stood out or did not stand out.</p>
<p>2. They estimate Baby Van is about 11 oz. now and is right on track for the April 22 due date.</p>
<p>3. Heartbeat was at 158.Â  So still right up in the the 150-160 range.</p>
<p>4. 10 fingers, 10 toes.Â  Everything else was present and accounted for in the right locations.</p>
<p>5. The first view we got of the little hand, it was doing the Star Trek &#8220;Live long and Prosper&#8221; hand thing, with the pinkie and ring finger spread apart from the middle and index finger. Seeing as how I watched that movie over the weekend, I believe we have a movie buff on our hands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a call out to any existing parents (or those in the know with baby stuff)&#8230;</p>
<p>We are starting our registries, and just basic planning, so I would love to hear from you the baby-related items that you couldn&#8217;t have lived without. There is just so much out there that we&#8217;re overwhelmed with where to start. I don&#8217;t want to end up with 100 burp rags and forget that we need some other essential item.Â  And because Babies &#8216;R Us sells the Wii, we need some help staying on track with baby things and not fun parent toys!</p>
<p>So, feel free to post your thoughts, lists, etc.Â  Any help is appreciated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We went today for our 12 week appointment and have confirmation there is a baby &#8211; one with a heartbeat at 160 beats per minute.</p>
<p>I think both Eric and I were looking forward to this confirmation.Â  It&#8217;s not so much that we didn&#8217;t believe we were having a baby (all the signs point to yes) but there is still this hanging doubt until you actually hear or see the actual little being. Everything at the appointment was normal, and it didn&#8217;t take long for our doctor to find the heartbeat. It took a couple seconds for us to realize what we were listening too, but once it set in, it was really cool!Â  It seemed like it went all too fast &#8211; I could have sat and listened to that for a long time. Of course I realize the doctor has other patients too <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Â  Now, I&#8217;m looking forward to our 20 week appointment when we get to have the ultrasound.</p>
<p>Overall I&#8217;m still feeling queasy, but it&#8217;s not so much all day like it was before.Â  Now I just seem to have moments when it&#8217;s really bad, and then they pass.Â  I&#8217;m hoping that means I am starting to move out of this phase.Â  More than anything, I look forward to going out to eat and having more than just a baked potato sound good. In the long run, any sickness is worth every bit, but I can&#8217;t wait to go get a good cheese enchilada meal and actually enjoy it!</p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;re at the 12 week period, the cat is pretty much out of the bag.Â  We appreciate all the well wishes you have sent, and look forward to sharing more of the fun moments as we go along. And, for those of you with children, I welcome any suggestions of items we should make sure to have with a newborn.Â  There is so much out there, we don&#8217;t even know where to start.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now &#8211; it will be the dad-to-be&#8217;s turn next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At first glance, you&#8217;re probably thinking &#8220;What?!? You aren&#8217;t supposed to be drinking&#8221;</p>
<p>Rest assured, I haven&#8217;t been.Â  But the past couple weeks have left me feeling like I have.Â  Whoever called it morning sickness obviously did not experience the all day sickness I have.Â  Luckily, I haven&#8217;t actually gotten sick, but have definitely had the all day queasiness. It&#8217;s not ever been bad, but just enough to remind you that food isn&#8217;t always your friend. I&#8217;ve foundÂ  stuff that continues to taste good, so lately I&#8217;ve been filling up on pretzels, watermelon, grapefruit, and McDonald&#8217;s french fries. Â  According to the lady at the doctor, morning sickness is similar to a hangover; both are based off low blood sugar.Â  So basically while you&#8217;re pregnant you get the same effects of alcohol, just without the fun night before <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;ll take the not feeling well, knowing what&#8217;s on the other end.Â  It still hasn&#8217;t really set in, but as we slowly tell more people it becomes a little more real each day. It&#8217;s crazy to me that we&#8217;ve already known for nearly five weeks &#8211; I feel like we should have the nursery all ready by now. I know both Eric and I are looking forward to the next appointment on October 6th when we can hopefully hear the heartbeat&#8230;at that point I think the reality of the whole situation will be fully realized.Â  Plus, it will give us the assurance that there really is a little being growing, and not just me growing from donuts!</p>
<p>Overall this has been a good experience &#8211; more than anything, I love being able to tell people and seeing how excited they are for us.Â  Nothing beats telling your grandmas that they get to be great grandmas.Â  And as more and more people know, that means the fewer &#8220;fake drinks&#8221; I have to have.</p>
