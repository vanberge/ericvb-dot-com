					<description><![CDATA[Christine Ann,
Just so you know it, you kept me up with all your moving around!  I can remember when Dad got to not only feel you move but see an elbow or knee jut out! You also made my belly look quite lopsided when you would move to one side or the other.  I too thought it was very cool when I could first feel you move.  It is not something a mother forgets.

Have fun with the room.  I can&#039;t wait to see it all come together.

Love you a hundred million!
