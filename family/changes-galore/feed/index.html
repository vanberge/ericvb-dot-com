					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing the pictures.  What a change since I saw you at Uncle Dave&#039;s house on New Year&#039;s Day!  

Can&#039;t wait to see the chair you picked out.  Was it one we looked at when we were at Baby&#039;s R Us?  Glad you found the changing table you wanted too.

I can&#039;t wait to have my hand on your stomach and feel Baby Van!  I am jealous that Jill got to have a turn before me! :)  What I would really like is to have a time when Jill is there too and we both can feel Baby Van together!!  That way I can give Jill a hug too!

Remember that I can help out too.  I also volunteer your brother and dad as well!

Love you, Eric and Baby Van a hundred million.

					<description><![CDATA[I am so excited for Chris and Eric!  I love having the opportunity to touch Chris&#039; stomach at every possible moment to try and feel Baby Van...although Baby Van does not always want to move with my hand there!  I can&#039;t wait to see what great parents you two are going to be with a new addition to your family.  I&#039;m thankful to have such wonderful people in my life and to enjoy in your blessing.  Love you guys!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You look so beautiful with a baby bump, Chris.
I know what an exciting time this is for you and Eric.  You two will be the greatest parents.  I know this because you are both such great people.

					<description><![CDATA[O you look so cute! Looks like you popped just after I saw you, bummer! I always walked around the house with my shirt pulled up :0) Congrats on getting so close to the date, it&#039;s going to go quick! Can&#039;t wait to see pics of the nursery! Great seeing you even though it was brief!
