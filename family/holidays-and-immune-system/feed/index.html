					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s funny how the priorities change... and also what you find your focus switches to... all of it is common, and it doesn&#039;t stop... we find even now that we change as grandparents, loving the changes and how we see your lives evolving - just as ours did back in the day... LOL

Enjoy it all... it&#039;s a fantastic trip, and the journey is amazing!]]></description>
