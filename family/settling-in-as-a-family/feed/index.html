					<description><![CDATA[You guys (all three of you!) are awesome!  I love watching you with Chase.  He knows who you are - he lights up when he sees you or hears you.

Thank you for sharing him with me.  I love being a grandma.  I think I have sang every song I know and every saying I remember doing with Chris and Dale!  I know Eric wonders where some of them came from.  Great Grandma Paulsen knew a lot of crazy and fun songs!

Chase and I will keep working on letters, words and numbers.  I can already tell he is going to be a reader - yeah!  He will be ready for first grade before we know it!
