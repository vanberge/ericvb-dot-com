					<description><![CDATA[Okay, I admit that April seems so far away!  I feel so fortunate to have both of you in my life and now Baby Van!  I also feel fortunate that the Johnson&#039;s and the VanBergen&#039;s are already connected through the many times we have been able to get together and that we have &quot;grown&quot; into a family unit that this little baby will be a part of.  I am so glad that Grandma and Grandpa VB will be sharing this grandchild with us, Grandma and Grandpa J.  We will be an awesome combination!

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Chris and Eric,
I cannot tell you how happy and excited we are for you and us.  Grandpa Tubbs, Kristi, and Jenny are so happy!
I am so happy that you told all of us in the way that you did.  You gave me such a memory.  I&#039;ve read the &quot;baby&quot; card a hundred times.
Enjoy every moment!!!
I am so proud of you both.  I know that you will be amazing parents because you are amazing people.
Love you lots,
Grandma Kathy VB]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First post to baby van from grandpa mickeyvb: You are going to be a very special person, as you have inherited some AMAZING genes. The combination of your mom and dad&#039;s heritages will no doubt bestow upon you the ability to do ANYTHING! How you handle such a vast array of talents and traits is entirely up to you, but just know that your Grandma Donna and Grandma Kathy be guiding (and spoiling) you the whole way.... g.g. mom and dad!!!]]></description>
