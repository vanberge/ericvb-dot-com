					<description><![CDATA[Okay...! How do you top any of the above?!?! I sure cannot!

What I can do is say this: Chase, you have come into a family that will ALWAYS support you in whatever you do, and love you always. Your mom and dad are two very special people that had the love and support that you will.

Take your time growing up, because your parents and grandparents will want to savor every moment, and we all know just how fast the time really does go by. You will have a lot of learning about your family history, and some very wonderful people that weren&#039;t able to be here when you were born. They are still watching over all of us, and admiring all that your parents and you have/will become.

We will always do the same, and share endless stories of just how your parents became what they are, and how sometimes they had their &#039;moments&#039; with us, so yes, it is okay to make mistakes, learn from them, and continue on... 

The only other thing I can think of to tell you is this: 

&quot;Welcome to Our Family, Chase! We are so happy to know and love you!

					<description><![CDATA[Eric,
This message is for you...Your words reflect what a wonderful man you have grown to be.  You are so much like your dad, and I am so happy about that.  I know that you are a great husband to a wonderful woman and that you will treasure each day as a father.
I am so very proud of you and Chris and am so thankful to be a grandmother to your son.  I will be the kind of grandmother to your son that my mom was to you and Steve.
I love you all so very much.
Mom]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chase,
You have put a handprint on Grandma Johnson&#039;s heart (I will explain this to you when you are older).  I can&#039;t wait to share books and music with you and take you places.  I will be here whenever you need me. My house will be your house too!  

There are so many people on the Johnson and Paulsen side of your family that are so glad you are in their lives.  We have so much to share with you and we can&#039;t wait for you to share with us.  Our lives are so much better now that you are here.

I love you a hundred million! (I will also tell you about this saying when you are older.)  I want you to also know how much I love your Mom and Dad.
