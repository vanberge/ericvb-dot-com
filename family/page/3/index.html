				<h2><a href="../../two-and-three-quarters/trackback/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Two and Three-Quarters">Two and Three-Quarters</a></h2>
				<small>February 22nd, 2010 <!-- by Eric and Chris --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Today we had our next check-up appointment.  We&#8217;re at the point where we go every two weeks, so time is really starting to fly. When the Dr. came in he asked Eric and I &#8221; How are the two and a half of you doing?&#8221;  Then as we talked, we realized it&#8217;s more like two and three-quarters, of us since Baby Van is a few days from being 32 weeks old. If I go full term that only leaves us 8 more weeks!!</p>
<p>Things are slowly progressing in the baby room. At this point, we&#8217;re just waiting for the carpeting to come in and get installed so we can get the paint up, and get furniture moved into the room. I&#8217;m really hoping that the carpeting being here &#8220;within three weeks&#8221; ends up being less than two so that we can get moving. Although we still have a month before we hit that 36 week point, at which Baby Van would be okay entering the world, I&#8217;m getting nervous that we&#8217;re going to be scrambling. My goal is to have everything set in the room by March 31st. Somehow I think that date will be here before we know it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to start putting stuff in the room and seeing it all come together. We&#8217;ve got lots of things to start putting away, thanks to all our great friends and family who have helped stock us with all kinds of fun baby stuff &#8211; right now the basement looks like Babies R Us has moved in. It really makes Eric and I appreciate how many people care about us 🙂</p>
<p>Not much else to update right now &#8211; for those who are keeping track, the heartbeat today was right around 140.  We&#8217;ve mostly been in the 150s, with one other time where it was 136. So, basically Baby Van likes to keep us all guessing.</p>
<p>And finally, some more baby bump photos &#8211; the little guy/gal had definitely expanded his or her living quarters!<a href="http://www.ericvb.com/family/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/portrait32_weeks.jpg"><br />

				<h2><a href="../../ultrasound-v2/trackback/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Ultrasound V2">Ultrasound V2</a></h2>
				<small>February 10th, 2010 <!-- by Eric and Chris --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Finally &#8220;Dad&#8221; getting around to posting an update!</p>
<p>Today we were excited to have a second ultrasound &#8211; the premise of seeing how Baby Van  has developed and grown has been is something I think we&#8217;ve both looked forward to since the appointment was scheduled.  Normally I think people may just get one ultrasound at the 20 week mark; but Chris was measuring slightly below her doctor&#8217;s expectations.  So, they just wanted to do another ultrasound and measurements to verify due dates, growth rates, and everything else was still in line.</p>
<p>As expected, everything is indeed fine &#8211; her measurements are on track for our due date and the baby size rates at the 55th percentile.  The ultrasound was cool!  Baby Van is definitely more developed and has much less free space to move around in.  We still didn&#8217;t find out the boy/girl factor (sorry moms) &#8211; so that will still be a suprise on Baby Van&#8217;s Birthday&#8230;  But man it&#8217;s just crazy to me the level of detail you can see on the baby&#8217;s face/hands/feet with modern ultrasound technology.  Although we weren&#8217;t able to get a 3d rendering this time due to lack of  free space and positioning.</p>
<p>After the ultrasound, final checks with the doc revealed normal heartbeats, etc &#8211; so it seems everything is on track sailing smoothly.</p>
<p>Chris is now coming up to 30 weeks &#8211; so we kick into an appointment every two weeks during this 10 week home stretch&#8230;  Man, time sure is flying.  I&#8217;ve got a lot of drywall work and painting to do and the clock is ticking a little faster than I&#8217;d like to admit.  🙁</p>
<p>The ultrasound technician said that video recording of any ultrasound is prohibited &#8211; she seemed like she wouldn&#8217;t have been to much of a problem to convince otherwise (since she thought my Flip was a cell phone) but I decided I would follow established procedures.  So, bummer &#8211; no video.  Blah blah blah &#8211; enough talky.  Here are the ultrasound pics!</p>

				<small>February 6th, 2010 <!-- by Eric and Chris --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>We have officially moved into our &#8220;third trimester&#8221; which means we are getting closer to the debut of Baby Van. In the meantime, the mom- and dad-to-be are starting to pull things together to change what was the official junk room into a cute, inviting, and oh yeah &#8211; safe &#8211; place for the newest addition to reside.</p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d take this chance to post a few images (some that are stock, some that are ours) of the things we have for the room so far. We went this week and made a decision on the paint color (Tiggers Tummy to be exact &#8211; a light, but bright yellow) and carpeting for the room. Now it&#8217;s just a matter of pulling it all together.</p>
<p>Also, we get to have another glimpse at the actual Baby Van this coming Wednesday. At my last appointment the doctor felt it would be a good idea to have another ultrasound since I&#8217;m measuring a little small for how far along I am. She seemed to think everything is fine, but they just want to take measurements of the baby to be sure. Both Eric and I are excited for the chance to see our little guy/gal on the ultrasound again, but also want to ensure everything is okay. Eric&#8217;s hoping to be able to take a video when we go, so we&#8217;ll try to post that. If anything, we should have some photos at least. And, for those who are wondering (the grandma&#8217;s especially :)), we are still not planning to find out the sex.  And no, we won&#8217;t have them just tell you.  So, look for that post later this week.</p>
<p>Onward to the fun stuff&#8230;images are below.</p>

				<h2><a href="../../changes-galore/trackback/index.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Changes Galore">Changes Galore</a></h2>
				<small>January 18th, 2010 <!-- by Eric and Chris --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>All kinds of changes going on it seems in lots of ways:</p>
<p>First, and most obvious &#8211; it&#8217;s a new year. Since we found out we were expecting last August, it&#8217;s always been &#8220;We&#8217;re due April of next year.&#8221;  Suddenly we&#8217;ve realized that we can&#8217;t say that anymore &#8211; it&#8217;s April of this year!  For whatever reason, that small change has had a big impact and has found us spending our weekends working at getting our house in order, picking out furniture, etc.  All the things that we felt like we had plenty of time to do are now having to actually become priorities. The start of 2010 has been a good kick in the pants to get moving &#8211; especially with the realization that we are getting close to the three months left mark!</p>
<p>Second &#8211; we now officially have a changing table in the soon-to-be Baby Van&#8217;s room. Late December we found a good deal on a crib and dresser set that I put on layway (since we aren&#8217;t quite prepared for all the furniture) and then also found the glider/recliner we liked, which is also kindly being stored at Babies R Us for now. We decided that we wanted to have an actual changing table since the dresser is pretty small and were lucky enough to find a floor sample that was a good match for the crib/dresser. Of course, we had to take it that day so we have our first real piece of baby furniture. Having that in the room has made the transition even more real &#8211; especially for the cat who is having a hard time figuring out what&#8217;s happening to what has always been her room 🙂  We&#8217;ve been working hard to clean the room out to get it ready for new carpeting/paint/etc. As we get things further along we&#8217;ll post some photos.</p>
<p>Third major change &#8211; and the one that&#8217;s been the most fun &#8211; is that Baby Van has apparently found out how to effectively use his/her arms and legs. No longer am I just feeling the little flutters here and there. Now I&#8217;m getting jabbed and punched pretty frequently, to the point that I can sit and watch my stomach move around. It really is pretty mesmerizing to watch &#8211; I find myself sitting around the house with my shirt pulled up so I can see all the movement. Eric has been able to feel the movement a lot more now too, which I think has been pretty cool for him. And today Molly was laying by me with her head on my belly and I was just waiting for her to get her first inkling of Baby Van.  I&#8217;m sure that will come soon enough! I know for some, they&#8217;d prefer to not have people touching their bellies &#8211; but since it&#8217;s all so new to me I want to have everybody feel the movement. Baby Van might be a little shy, because it seems like the movement stops whenever I try to share it with someone, but I&#8217;m sure there will be enough to go around in the next three months.</p>
<p>Finally &#8211; in addition to Baby Van&#8217;s changing &#8211; I&#8217;m seeing my physical changes. I had to officially move into maternity pants (which really are some of the most comfortable pants to wear, although not the most flattering) as my regular pants were past the point of being buttoned or zipped. Although Baby Van seems to be tucked away in my torso, I finally have a baby bump, which I am thankful for, as it gives some validity to the &#8220;I&#8217;m due in April&#8221; statement. And to go along with that, we&#8217;ve started the photos &#8211; I&#8217;ve posted two for your enjoyment 🙂</p>

<p>With all the things that are starting to come together, and with us getting closer and closer to Baby Van&#8217;s official birthdate, we hope to post more frequently, especially as we get the room started/finished. Our next doctor&#8217;s appointment is in just over a week so we&#8217;ll share more info then as well. Lots of changes so far, and many more to come &#8211; but all have been exciting!</p>

					<p>If so, that must be what&#8217;s going on.  🙂</p>
<p>I am definitely now feeling movement &#8211; not so much jabs at this point, as it is rolling and turning.  And so far, it seems as though Baby Van is more of a night owl, usually starting up around 5:00pm and continuing into the evening.  It&#8217;s pretty cool to feel the movement, but also a little strange. All this time we&#8217;ve known there was a baby in there, and the ultrasound further confirmed that, but with the movement it&#8217;s a new level of awareness. I know Eric is looking forward to the time when he can feel something too &#8211; although that means I&#8217;m getting jabbed hard enough for an outside person to notice &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m looking forward to that or not!</p>
<p>In general, things seem to be plugging away just fine, and the weeks seem to be flying by. We both realize that we will need to kick into gear after the holidays and start getting our house (and ourselves) baby ready. Slowly the extra room is getting cleaned out and soon will be revamped into a nursery. We&#8217;re coming to terms that we need to tackle picking out baby furniture, and more importantly, entering the wide-world of Babies &#8216;R Us. If you want to feel overwhelmed, just walk into the bottle aisle &#8211; then as you&#8217;re running the other way, you get lost in the jumpy seat aisle, and turned around in the diaper aisle.  Soon the place has you trapped, and the only way out seems to be to register for everything &#8220;just in case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, maybe it&#8217;s not that bad, but we both have realized there&#8217;s a lot to do, and that we should probably get ourselves moving sooner than later. So come January, we&#8217;re all engines ready to go.</p>
<p>So keep checking back, as we have many  more updates to come &#8211; and as we get the nursery piece started we&#8217;ll put up some photos.</p>

					<p>Okay, so maybe the second part isn&#8217;t quite relevant, but how do you start that song lyric and not finish it?</p>
<p>Officially this week we are half way.  20 weeks down, 20 to go.  The past few weeks have shown great improvement in the sense that food is once again my friend, and all the things I like to eat are sounding appetizing again. Hence, I have had Mexican food any chance I get. However, after our appointment yesterday, I found out I am not gaining as much as I should be at this point, so I&#8217;m now making it a point to eat more ice cream in there too.  I read on a website that&#8217;s a good way to gain weight, and I&#8217;m not going to argue with anybody who tells me to eat ice cream every day 🙂</p>
<p>It was amazing to have the ultrasound and see little Van moving around. It&#8217;s crazy to actually see a living thing moving inside you. I think both Eric and I were just kind of in awe for the whole appointment.  Unfortunately, the little guy/gal wasn&#8217;t cooperating and kept his/her arm up by its head the whole time blocking it&#8217;s little face (or as russelltee said, doing the sprinkler dance).  So, you&#8217;ll see that in a lot of the photos. Otherwise we got a good view of the baby and from what we saw and they said, all is well.  Here&#8217;s the stats:</p>
<p>1.First &#8211; no, we did not change our minds and find out the sex. Eric has his suspicion that it&#8217;s a girl, I think it&#8217;s a boy &#8211; so even after the appointment we have not a clue. Let&#8217;s just say there wasn&#8217;t anything that stood out or did not stand out.</p>
<p>2. They estimate Baby Van is about 11 oz. now and is right on track for the April 22 due date.</p>
<p>3. Heartbeat was at 158.  So still right up in the the 150-160 range.</p>
<p>4. 10 fingers, 10 toes.  Everything else was present and accounted for in the right locations.</p>
<p>5. The first view we got of the little hand, it was doing the Star Trek &#8220;Live long and Prosper&#8221; hand thing, with the pinkie and ring finger spread apart from the middle and index finger. Seeing as how I watched that movie over the weekend, I believe we have a movie buff on our hands.</p>

					<p>This is a call out to any existing parents (or those in the know with baby stuff)&#8230;</p>
<p>We are starting our registries, and just basic planning, so I would love to hear from you the baby-related items that you couldn&#8217;t have lived without. There is just so much out there that we&#8217;re overwhelmed with where to start. I don&#8217;t want to end up with 100 burp rags and forget that we need some other essential item.  And because Babies &#8216;R Us sells the Wii, we need some help staying on track with baby things and not fun parent toys!</p>
<p>So, feel free to post your thoughts, lists, etc.  Any help is appreciated.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In more ways than one, things are sort of on &#8220;Cruise Control&#8221; for the time being&#8230;</p>
<p>In the most literal sense, we purchased a new car!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a bit of a big investment and alot of money to throw down with a baby on the way &#8211; but we didn&#8217;t really have a choice.  I don&#8217;t think either of us were up to trying to cram all of our stuff along with a dog and a new baby into either of our two door coupe vehicles.  So, one of them had to get the axe in favor of something more family friendly.</p>
<p>We ended up purchasing a 2007 Chrysler Pacifica (Black, leather interior, very good shape) and are in the process of selling Chris&#8217; Dodge Stratus.  It&#8217;s working out perfectly&#8230; And so far we are very happy with the car.  It&#8217;ll definitely provide a much more comfortable ride all around &#8211; and the 3rd row seating gives us the space we&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, this time of the pregnancy has felt like we&#8217;re just cruising right along.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had one follow up appointment where we heard the heartbeat again, and Chris has seemed to be getting over the &#8220;morning sickness&#8221; phase.  The next appointment after Thanksgiving will be the biggie where we get the first ultrasound (20 weeks).  It&#8217;s a little weird to me to think that we&#8217;re already almost halfway through &#8211; but both of us are only looking forward to everything that lies ahead.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be sure to get some pictures up of our new car &#8211; and also look forward to posting our first ultrasound pics after we get them in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone!</p>
<p>PS &#8211; For all those wondering &#8211; I think we&#8217;re still going to &#8220;not find out&#8221; whether we&#8217;re having a boy or girl &#8211; so we&#8217;re shooting for the surprise.  🙂</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>We went today for our 12 week appointment and have confirmation there is a baby &#8211; one with a heartbeat at 160 beats per minute.</p>
<p>I think both Eric and I were looking forward to this confirmation.  It&#8217;s not so much that we didn&#8217;t believe we were having a baby (all the signs point to yes) but there is still this hanging doubt until you actually hear or see the actual little being. Everything at the appointment was normal, and it didn&#8217;t take long for our doctor to find the heartbeat. It took a couple seconds for us to realize what we were listening too, but once it set in, it was really cool!  It seemed like it went all too fast &#8211; I could have sat and listened to that for a long time. Of course I realize the doctor has other patients too 🙂  Now, I&#8217;m looking forward to our 20 week appointment when we get to have the ultrasound.</p>
<p>Overall I&#8217;m still feeling queasy, but it&#8217;s not so much all day like it was before.  Now I just seem to have moments when it&#8217;s really bad, and then they pass.  I&#8217;m hoping that means I am starting to move out of this phase.  More than anything, I look forward to going out to eat and having more than just a baked potato sound good. In the long run, any sickness is worth every bit, but I can&#8217;t wait to go get a good cheese enchilada meal and actually enjoy it!</p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;re at the 12 week period, the cat is pretty much out of the bag.  We appreciate all the well wishes you have sent, and look forward to sharing more of the fun moments as we go along. And, for those of you with children, I welcome any suggestions of items we should make sure to have with a newborn.  There is so much out there, we don&#8217;t even know where to start.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now &#8211; it will be the dad-to-be&#8217;s turn next.</p>

					<p>At first glance, you&#8217;re probably thinking &#8220;What?!? You aren&#8217;t supposed to be drinking&#8221;</p>
<p>Rest assured, I haven&#8217;t been.  But the past couple weeks have left me feeling like I have.  Whoever called it morning sickness obviously did not experience the all day sickness I have.  Luckily, I haven&#8217;t actually gotten sick, but have definitely had the all day queasiness. It&#8217;s not ever been bad, but just enough to remind you that food isn&#8217;t always your friend. I&#8217;ve found  stuff that continues to taste good, so lately I&#8217;ve been filling up on pretzels, watermelon, grapefruit, and McDonald&#8217;s french fries.   According to the lady at the doctor, morning sickness is similar to a hangover; both are based off low blood sugar.  So basically while you&#8217;re pregnant you get the same effects of alcohol, just without the fun night before 🙂</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;ll take the not feeling well, knowing what&#8217;s on the other end.  It still hasn&#8217;t really set in, but as we slowly tell more people it becomes a little more real each day. It&#8217;s crazy to me that we&#8217;ve already known for nearly five weeks &#8211; I feel like we should have the nursery all ready by now. I know both Eric and I are looking forward to the next appointment on October 6th when we can hopefully hear the heartbeat&#8230;at that point I think the reality of the whole situation will be fully realized.  Plus, it will give us the assurance that there really is a little being growing, and not just me growing from donuts!</p>
<p>Overall this has been a good experience &#8211; more than anything, I love being able to tell people and seeing how excited they are for us.  Nothing beats telling your grandmas that they get to be great grandmas.  And as more and more people know, that means the fewer &#8220;fake drinks&#8221; I have to have.</p>
