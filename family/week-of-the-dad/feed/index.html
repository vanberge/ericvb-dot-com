					<description><![CDATA[He likes his time with you! You are an awesome dad and you and Chris make an awesome team. Chase and Carter are blessed to have you and Chris as their mom and dad as you are to have them as your sons. I love the time you have allowed me to be one of those visitors or when you have visited us. Having both sets of my grandparents was such an important part of my life and I am glad Chris could be as close as she was with her grandparents and how she continues to keep connected to Marie. I so look forward to all the times to come with my grandsons and hope I can come even close to giving them what was shared with me by Christine’s grandparents and my grandparents. Love all of you a hundred million.]]></description>
