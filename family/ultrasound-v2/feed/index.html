					<description><![CDATA[Eric and Christine,
Thanks for the pictures.  When Chris called me this morning to let me know the update from the doctor appointment, she said pictures would follow.  Baby Van is beautiful!  I can&#039;t wait to hold those feet and hands.  Like Grandma VB, I too had hoped there might be a &quot;revealing&quot; photo but I can also wait until Baby Van&#039;s B-day.  

As Grandma VB shared, I am so happy for all of us but especially for Baby Van to have you as parents. 

Love all Three of you &quot;A Hundred Million&quot;,

Grandma Johnson

PS  Great Grandma Paulsen shared with me that it was more than okay for us to pass on her saying whenever we could.  I would like to share it with Baby Van in Great Grandma&#039;s honor.   :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Mom! 

Hopefully not crying at how much money you&#039;re going to have to spend.  haha.  :-)

Really the whole thing is very exciting and I&#039;m almost sad that it&#039;s moving so fast.  We&#039;ll be home with a kid before I know it, it feels like.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Eric and Chris,
I am so glad that baby Van is doing well!  I was sure hoping you would accidentally see something, or not!  I will be happy to be surprised on baby Van&#039;s birthday.
Don&#039;t worry too much about all the &quot;stuff&quot; you have to do to get ready.  Some how it always works out.
I am just so happy for all of us.
Eric, that was a very nice post you made on baby Van&#039;s log.
Love to you three!
