					<description><![CDATA[I always love to read what you write.  I feel the same way about Chase wanting to have his slumber parties with his grandma.  At some point he won&#039;t want to do it.  I cherish those moments as well.  We watch movies, eat snacks, read books, talk, and laugh!  Priceless moments.

And your dad and I didn&#039;t get a full night&#039;s sleep for 3 years.

You and Chris are amazing parents.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, it was you two that helped ME... You know very well just from your &#039;limited&#039; experience that you would do ANYTHING (including spending hours/days to get an old school system to run new games) just to see the smiles that come from the awe and wonder of seeing ideas come to life, and the pride of your being part of that. All that you tackle is driven by those smiles, and have no fear, they will continue to push you to your next &#039;gap&#039; closure. I&#039;ve gotten where I am by your smiles... 8 )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[He likes his time with you! You are an awesome dad and you and Chris make an awesome team. Chase and Carter are blessed to have you and Chris as their mom and dad as you are to have them as your sons. I love the time you have allowed me to be one of those visitors or when you have visited us. Having both sets of my grandparents was such an important part of my life and I am glad Chris could be as close as she was with her grandparents and how she continues to keep connected to Marie. I so look forward to all the times to come with my grandsons and hope I can come even close to giving them what was shared with me by Christine’s grandparents and my grandparents. Love all of you a hundred million.]]></description>
