					<description><![CDATA[I always love to read what you write.  I feel the same way about Chase wanting to have his slumber parties with his grandma.  At some point he won&#039;t want to do it.  I cherish those moments as well.  We watch movies, eat snacks, read books, talk, and laugh!  Priceless moments.

And your dad and I didn&#039;t get a full night&#039;s sleep for 3 years.

You and Chris are amazing parents.]]></description>
