					<description><![CDATA[You have a wonderful start on the room for Baby Van.  Just remember, he/she will not be too interested in the room now but more interested in Mom and Dad. Don&#039;t be worried if &quot;everything&quot; doesn&#039;t get accomplished.  You need to enjoy this time and not worry about all the things on your To Do List.  Make sure to keep time for each other, get enough rest, and enjoy each day.  

I love the photo&#039;s and frames.  Did I see a giraffe?!

I will be interested in the possible video from your next appointment.  I still think it would be okay for the grandmas to know but I will wait!

Love you both and Baby Van A Hundred Million,
Grandma J]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Let the fun begin! The remodeling of a house to get it ready for your children is part of the fun parents get to have... when I stop and think of how much our house has changed over the years, I look back and think &quot;How in the world did I ever do that!&quot;... The answer: You learn on the fly! (Sorta like how you be a good mom and dad... it just happens over time!)

So let the learning process begin, and I am sure if either of you need any advice on anything at all, both sets of grandparents will EAGERLY give you all the advice you can stand... and much much more....  LMAO!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Baby Van&#039;s room is going to be so adorable!  I can&#039;t wait to see it when it is done.
The pictures look great!  And I love the baby furniture.
I&#039;m sure things will go well at the doctor.  
Enjoy this &quot;time&quot;.  There is nothing like it.
Love you both.
