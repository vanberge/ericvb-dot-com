					<description><![CDATA[So heart warming to read this!  Even though our (4) children are grown I found myself relating to your thoughts along the way!  Enjoy every minute because it&#039;s true when they say:  In a &quot;blink&quot; they are all grown up!  
Children are so wonderful and I&#039;ve always said that I was blessed to have (4) and would have had (4) more in a heart beat!!!  It is very apparent from reading your posts that you have so much love in your household - what a beautiful thing for your beautiful children!  Keep the pictures posted so we can enjoy your family!
Love to you all ...... kisses to the kiddies!!!!]]></description>
