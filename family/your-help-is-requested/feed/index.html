					<description><![CDATA[Congrats!!!!
I&#039;m sure you can use my advice.  All of our &quot;babies&quot; have really enjoyed chew toys and a ball to play fetch with.  I&#039;ll bet yours could use these as well.  (Perhaps in a different way:).
Enjoy all our shopping trips.

					<description><![CDATA[Christine and Eric,

Yes, grandmas and grandpas will be very important in your child&#039;s life. This child will have some very special ones.  I certainly enjoyed mine.  But Aunts named Martha will also be important.  I have it on good authority that she loves babies, and would welcome the opportunity to come running whrn a babysitter is needed.  You can put me on speed dial.  Also you can&#039;t have too many books!  This aunt loves to read!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys!  I have helped some other friends register before, so hopefully I can be of some help to you.

1. I really like the Koala Kids jersey crib sheets from BRUs - they are super soft and have great elastic.  They come on quite a few different solid colors that will match any decor.

2. I would disagree on the non-immediate need for a pack n play if you have a dog - it can be very handy to pop the babe into while you&#039;re doing dishes or going to the bathroom.  Eventually an exersaucer is excellent for that too and can be easily moved around the house.  We also use our pack n play a ton to go camping, over to friends&#039; houses for the evening, etc.  I would recommend sticking with something mid-line (nothing too basic and nothing too crazy fancy).

3. I agree on skipping the Diaper Genie - the refills are expensive.  Safety First makes a diaper pail with a lid for about $15-20 and you can use any trash bags in it.  I plan on getting one for the twins&#039; arrival and adding an air freshener.

4. We have never used bumpers on Sydney&#039;s crib but I&#039;m thinking about getting some of those breathable ones for the twins&#039; beds.  It has always been a pain when her pacifier falls out between the slats of the crib in the middle of the night!

5. Not sure who&#039;s throwing your baby shower(s), but our hostess had people bring books instead of cards which was totally awesome!  People wrote inside them like cards too.  Another idea is diapers instead of cards.

6. We have the Summer Infant video monitors which are totally awesome, especially for tech-y people like Eric!  They are pricey but worth the money - almost all of our friends have them too.

7. We are big advocates of sleep sacks and are still using them (Sydney is 17 mos.).  The Halo sleeveless ones are great and non-flammable.  They are often on sale at BRUs.  Now we use cotton quilted ones that are great too.

8. The JJ Cole Bundle Me&#039;s are wonderful for cold weather.  Even in the spring/fall you can unzip the top half and just use the bottom half to make the infant carseat cozier.

9. A bouncy seat is also a must!  I prefer the ones that sit a little more upright.

10. We love having a mirror in the backseat in order to see the baby while we&#039;re driving.  Very handy.

Okay, hopefully I didn&#039;t overdo it.  If I think of anything else, I will let you know.  Enjoy your pregnancy!  Mine is going super.

11. One more thing: If you plan on nursing, the Lansinoh lanolin cream is a lifesaver for the nips.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ignore all baby toys until the baby is at least 2 - 3 months old.  The baby won&#039;t play with them, and will ignore you when you play with them.

The Boppy is the greatest pillow ever.  Get one.  Get two covers.  

Pack n Play is not needed until baby starts crawling.

I&#039;ll add more later.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[you don&#039;t need a diaper genie. buy diapers in bulk but not at first, they go through sizes quick. get a plastic trash can with a closing lid. drop da diaper in the can, close the lid. easy. add an air freshner for fun.

you also don&#039;t need a &quot;wipe warmer&quot;. the baby won&#039;t even flinch when a slightly-less-than-room-temperature &quot;wipe&quot; is used.

get a stroller that comes with a carseat that can be detached and put in the car. usually a base is involved that latches to the car LATCH system or seat belt. mega handy to unlatch carseat from base and transfer to stroller.

i&#039;m sure i will have more tips to share in the future!@]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First... CONGRATS!!!!!!  How very very exciting!
Obviously I have no children of my own, but I work with lots of little ones.... so here are some thoughts.
*Lots of onesies!!  They make longsleeved ones with the cuffs on the ends so baby doesn&#039;t scratch his/her face.
*I have heard not to register for just one type of bottle... because sometimes the baby doesn&#039;t like a particular bottle.... gotta have variety to try!
*Swaddle blanket.....  or a sleep sack.... I see babies sleeping in them all the time... I want one, they look so cozy!

I will look around at work and see what other things babies have....  :)

Also... gotta plug KinderCare......  don&#039;t know what the plans are for after the baby is born, but I work at the KinderCare on 44th, between Byron Center and Ivanrest.......  :)  Our Infant Room is great....  Our Toddler room rocks (because I am the teacher!)
Honestly, if you are going to go the center route.... tour early.... and tour a lot, get a feel for what you really want and what is important to you.  And if you need questions to ask.... I would be more than happy to help you out!]]></description>
