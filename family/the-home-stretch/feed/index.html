					<description><![CDATA[I am not going to vote or make a guess.  This baby is already loved, as is and whenever he/she arrives.  This grandma waits with love, ready to hug and hold Baby Van.
Chris and Eric you have done a wonderful job with the room. It is such an inviting and warm space for you and Baby Van.  I can&#039;t wait to see Baby Van being held by both of you in this room!
Take care during this last few weeks.  Enjoy this time in your lives.  I remember waiting for Chris like is was yesterday!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looks like you&#039;re finally in the home stretch.....enjoy every last second of being pregnant, even though I know how impatient one gets in the end!  Our twins were born on March 30th and they are doing wonderfully.  I wish you all the best for labor/delivery and homecoming!  Can&#039;t wait to hear your news!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m voting for April 15th so I can meet the little guy/gal before we head on vacation!!  I&#039;m guessing it is a boy, but that child will be blessed (and spoiled by family and friends) no matter what sex it is.  I am so excited for you and Eric to meet your little one soon!  Come on out early, Baby Van!!  Love you guys!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The room looks great! I love the photo frame border. It&#039;s great whether Baby Van is a boy or girl!

I want to vote for the 27th of April since that was the day Christopher was born, but I am hoping you don&#039;t go past your due date.

Therefore, I am going to say Baby Van (a boy) will arrive on tax day!]]></description>
