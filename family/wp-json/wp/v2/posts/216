Sunday night as the weekend came to a close, I started experiencing a norovirus\/stomach flu like illness.  This spread to every adult who was around us over that weekend.  Grandma V, Grandpa V, Uncle Vanbergs, Aunt Kayla, myself and Chris all got similar symptoms within about 12 hours of each other.  That level of contagiousness just seemed insane.  A week later, the virus was apparently still around as Grandma and Grandpa J and uncle Dale all got it from a followup visit to our house&#8230; It was just nuts!  The main symptoms only lasted about 24 hours and then you were back on your feet within 48 hours or so (except in my case, more on this later though).<\/p>\n<p>Then Carter started getting badly congested and really had a terrible cough.  We took him to his pediatrician 2 times to make sure it wasn&#8217;t affecting his breathing and that his lungs were still clear.  It was pretty scary for me because some of the coughing fits he experienced really made him struggle to catch his breath in between coughs and would last what felt like minutes at a time.  This congestion worked its way throughout his entire Ear\/nose\/throat system and left him with a dual ear infection.  Which then led to antibiotics.  Which led to terrible baby diarrhea.  Which led to blistered baby bottom despite copious amounts of Desitin diaper rash cream.  Chris and I kept him home from daycare an entire week plus a couple days into the following week before he was well enough all around to make it back.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, while everyone else recovered from the stomach bug swimmingly, my symptoms worsened.  A couple doctor visits and I end up with GI track inflammation and a bladder infection.  My doc thinks it possibly developed into diverticulitis and he put me on 2 different antibiotics.  This really began doing the trick immediately; but I was also on a fairly strict diet of bland food and clear liquids only.  I really think this was the sickest I&#8217;ve ever been.  The bird like diet with this type of illness combined to lose me 19 pounds over a 14 day span of time.<\/p>\n<p>Chase somehow managed to avoid EVERYTHING.  Which leads me to believe he&#8217;s the one that spread all these germs to everybody. <\/p>\n<p>Finally, after what feels like forever, things have improved&#8230;  We went on a disinfecting spree, washed all bedding from all bedrooms, and even opened all our windows to air out our house in near-zero temperatures. This terrible couple week span only adds to how much this winter has absolutely sucked.  We&#8217;re all feeling claustrophobic and more often than not it&#8217;s been a struggle to keep everyone occupied. It&#8217;s important to remember the good times as well as the bad.  February, you were pretty bad&#8230;   <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>February was a brutal month for the VanBergen family.
