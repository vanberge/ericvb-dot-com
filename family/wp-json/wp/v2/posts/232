And, what I mean when I say this I guess is something like a generational divide.  Music, media, technology &#8211; the entire world really, all change at a rapid pace.  So, for me it&#8217;s easy to understand how a father might have difficulty relating to a child.  A father could easily have no idea how to get a new computer game set up.  A father could want his son to play baseball when the boy wants only to skateboard.  etc etc, you get my drift.  Granted, most of my experience in this area comes from the son&#8217;s perspective.  I&#8217;ve been a son for almost 34 years, but a father only 4.  Being a father now and having it pretty easy gives me a full appreciation what my father had to do and how great a job he did to relate to his boys.<\/p>\n<p>Computers as we know them didn&#8217;t exist when I was born.  Video games didn&#8217;t exist when I was born. But things changed quickly as I grew. Bugs bunny surrendered the crown of the cartoon realm to He-Man, Lion-O, and some humanoid amphibians that could do karate. Playing with cap guns outside yielded, at least in part, to the Nintendo Zapper.  I could go on forever with examples, my point is the world changed so quickly during my lifetime that I can only imagine what it felt like to try and keep up.  In a lot of ways, my brother and got to maybe learn along <em>with<\/em> my father.  I&#8217;m sure in fact that I owe my career to one of these areas in particular:  Him tirelessly experimenting with our computers to keep up with the relentless demand of his greedy sons and their countless computer games.  Sitting alongside him as he had to hack and tweak computers to run our games fostered a curiosity of my own with computers.  It&#8217;s amazing to me to think that a career in Healthcare I.T. started this way, but it truly did. <\/p>\n<p>Compared to my father, I have it pretty easy.  There are hardly any gaps for me to close.  At least, for now&#8230; The Ninja Turtles still have their place in the animated world and Mario and Luigi are still trying to figure out why Princess Peach doesn&#8217;t have a restraining order against Bowser.  If Chase (or Carter in the future) have trouble with a tough level of a video game, the chances are pretty good that I can help them without a great deal of effort.  If they want to skate board instead of play baseball I&#8217;ll be able to show them how to do an ollie and a shady shuvit.  But, at the same time, I haven&#8217;t lost the &#8220;old school&#8221; pieces.  I feel incredibly equipped and confident helping my boys with whatever life might throw at them, and whatever they might throw at me; whether it be old school or new.  This is a direct result of my father working so hard to fight these gaps that grew so quickly for him.  For that, I am immensely grateful.  <\/p>\n<p>Who knows, much of this might change as our lives continue.  If the gaps begin to grow, I know exactly what I have to do. Somebody has already shown me. <\/p>\n<p>This blog post would probably be very different if we had girls though.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Any father\/son relationship is going to have what I&#8217;m going to refer to as &#8220;gaps&#8221;.
