Check.<br \/>\nBaby room finished.  Check.<br \/>\nBottles and clothes washed.  Check.<br \/>\nHospital bags packed.  Check.<\/p>\n<p>With two weeks to go, we&#8217;re actually feeling pretty prepared for Baby Van&#8217;s arrival. I&#8217;m sure the minute we have to head to the hospital the feeling of preparation will go out the window about as fast as we drive, but in the meantime we&#8217;re just trying to enjoy the feeling.  It&#8217;s crazy to think that it&#8217;s been 9 months since we found out our family was going to grow, and yet at the same time, it seems like just yesterday.<\/p>\n<p>We have been having weekly appointments now, so we get to hear the heartbeat pretty regularly (still right around 140\/145). And since I have a cold, I ended up having an extra appointment in there too. So far things are still right on track &#8211; we&#8217;re just waiting for the first official sign that Baby Van is ready to enter the world. I have not had any contractions or other signs yet, so I think our little guy\/gal is just content hanging out for now. I&#8217;m glad things are going smoothly, but am starting to get anxious to meet our newest addition. And, now that we&#8217;re counting down the time in days instead of weeks, it&#8217;s only added to that feeling. At our last appointment they did confirm that they don&#8217;t like to have women go more than 7-10 days past their due date so we&#8217;ll have an April baby no matter what.  Eric thinks it will be on the 16th, I was thinking the 17th &#8211; but unfortunately it&#8217;s not up to us \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>Most of our time has been spent putting the finishing touches on everything. We spent time getting the car seat all set up in my car so that we aren&#8217;t trying to do that in the midst of heading to the hospital (which is a good thing, as it took us a little while to get it just right). I&#8217;ve been sorting and washing clothes and bottles so things are set when we come home. The bassinet is set up, and has yet to be discovered by the cat, so that should be ready for our first night at home. Probably the biggest piece was just finishing up the room. Since the last post we got our glider\/ottoman and finally got the picture frame border up. Overall I&#8217;m really happy with how it all turned out &#8211; it was fun to be able to take a room from plain to something fun and kid-like. And because most of the concept were things we did ourselves (from finding the fabric for the windows to painting\/finding the photos for the frames) it makes me that much more proud.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to think this will be our last post, but there&#8217;s a good chance we&#8217;ll have another one before the big day &#8211; especially if Baby Van holds out for a late April birthday!  And for anybody who is inclined to comment, we&#8217;d love to get your thoughts on whether the baby is a girl or a boy and what date you think they&#8217;ll make their debut.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_102\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/04\/DSC_5559-e1270693433183.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-102\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-102\" title=\"View from the Doorway\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/04\/DSC_5559-e1270693433183.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-102\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">View from the Doorway<\/p><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/04\/DSC_5559-e1270693433183.jpg\"><br \/>\n<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_105\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/04\/DSC_5564.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-105\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-105\" title=\"View towards Chair and Dresser with Wish Wall\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/04\/DSC_5564-e1270693586779.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-105\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chair\/Dresser\/Wish Wall<\/p><\/div>\n<div id=\"attachment_104\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/04\/DSC_5562.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-104\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-104\" title=\"DSC_5562\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/04\/DSC_5562-e1270693656316.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-104\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crib<\/p><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/04\/DSC_5560.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-103\" title=\"DSC_5560\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/04\/DSC_5560-e1270693751953.jpg\" alt=\"Swing\/Changing Table\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_106\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/04\/DSCF1014.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-106\" title=\"DSCF1014\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/04\/DSCF1014-e1270693793491.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-106\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Molly Testing the Chair with Me!<\/p><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Car seat installed.
