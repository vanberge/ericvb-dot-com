Since we found out we were expecting last August, it&#8217;s always been &#8220;We&#8217;re due April of next year.&#8221;\u00a0 Suddenly we&#8217;ve realized that we can&#8217;t say that anymore &#8211; it&#8217;s April of this year!\u00a0 For whatever reason, that small change has had a big impact and has found us spending our weekends working at getting our house in order, picking out furniture, etc.\u00a0 All the things that we felt like we had plenty of time to do are now having to actually become priorities. The start of 2010 has been a good kick in the pants to get moving &#8211; especially with the realization that we are getting close to the three months left mark!<\/p>\n<p>Second &#8211; we now officially have a changing table in the soon-to-be Baby Van&#8217;s room. Late December we found a good deal on a crib and dresser set that I put on layway (since we aren&#8217;t quite prepared for all the furniture) and then also found the glider\/recliner we liked, which is also kindly being stored at Babies R Us for now. We decided that we wanted to have an actual changing table since the dresser is pretty small and were lucky enough to find a floor sample that was a good match for the crib\/dresser. Of course, we had to take it that day so we have our first real piece of baby furniture. Having that in the room has made the transition even more real &#8211; especially for the cat who is having a hard time figuring out what&#8217;s happening to what has always been her room \ud83d\ude42\u00a0 We&#8217;ve been working hard to clean the room out to get it ready for new carpeting\/paint\/etc. As we get things further along we&#8217;ll post some photos.<\/p>\n<p>Third major change &#8211; and the one that&#8217;s been the most fun &#8211; is that Baby Van has apparently found out how to effectively use his\/her arms and legs. No longer am I just feeling the little flutters here and there. Now I&#8217;m getting jabbed and punched pretty frequently, to the point that I can sit and watch my stomach move around. It really is pretty mesmerizing to watch &#8211; I find myself sitting around the house with my shirt pulled up so I can see all the movement. Eric has been able to feel the movement a lot more now too, which I think has been pretty cool for him. And today Molly was laying by me with her head on my belly and I was just waiting for her to get her first inkling of Baby Van.\u00a0 I&#8217;m sure that will come soon enough! I know for some, they&#8217;d prefer to not have people touching their bellies &#8211; but since it&#8217;s all so new to me I want to have everybody feel the movement. Baby Van might be a little shy, because it seems like the movement stops whenever I try to share it with someone, but I&#8217;m sure there will be enough to go around in the next three months.<\/p>\n<p>Finally &#8211; in addition to Baby Van&#8217;s changing &#8211; I&#8217;m seeing my physical changes. I had to officially move into maternity pants (which really are some of the most comfortable pants to wear, although not the most flattering) as my regular pants were past the point of being buttoned or zipped. Although Baby Van seems to be tucked away in my torso, I finally have a baby bump, which I am thankful for, as it gives some validity to the &#8220;I&#8217;m due in April&#8221; statement. And to go along with that, we&#8217;ve started the photos &#8211; I&#8217;ve posted two for your enjoyment \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/DSCF1006-e1263787347949.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-45\" title=\"The Official &quot;Baby Bump&quot;\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/DSCF1006-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/DSCF1007-e1263787379207.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-46\" title=\"Baby Bump 2\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/DSCF1007-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>With all the things that are starting to come together, and with us getting closer and closer to Baby Van&#8217;s official birthdate, we hope to post more frequently, especially as we get the room started\/finished.
