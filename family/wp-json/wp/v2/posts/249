Sure. \u00a0Would I want to change it? \u00a0Nope.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a piece of this that I cherish, and that is having Chase want to sleep in the same bed as his dad. \u00a0At some point it will be wierd. \u00a0At some point he won&#8217;t want to do it. \u00a0And when that happens, I&#8217;m going to miss it. \u00a0The nightly routine of reading some books together and talking about life gives me a great perspective on him as a person. \u00a0 Instead of being negative about how the sleep schedule is crazy and changes daily, I&#8217;m looking at what pieces I&#8217;ll miss after everything finally does go \u00a0back to normal.<\/p>\n<p>For now, the sleeping is what it is, and it&#8217;s normal for our family. \u00a0That&#8217;s good enough for me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I can remember when we first had Chase, it seemed like there was such a focus on a sleeping schedule. \u00a0With our first kid, we didn&#8217;t know any better. \u00a0We didn&#8217;t know what &#8220;normal&#8221; meant. \u00a0We went off of parenting books and everyday conversations. \u00a0The books heavily referred to establishing a sleeping schedule, and many [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[4],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/44.203.20.51\/family\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/249"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/44.203.20.51\/family\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/44.203.20.51\/family\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/44.203.20.51\/family\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/44.203.20.51\/family\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=249"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/44.203.20.51\/family\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/249\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":251,"href":"http:\/\/44.203.20.51\/family\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/249\/revisions\/251"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/44.203.20.51\/family\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=249"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/44.203.20.51\/family\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=249"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/44.203.20.51\/family\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=249"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
