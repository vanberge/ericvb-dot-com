We didn&#8217;t go to any baby classes. We didn&#8217;t take pictures or blog every facet of the pregnancy. We felt like we were pros. This over confidence caused a bit of procrastination on Dad&#8217;s part. &#8220;Oh, we have 4 weeks to get the room ready, paint, get out clothes, car seats, bottles, etc?&#8221; &#8230; Granted, much of that was busy work and we did get it done with plenty of time to spare, but I was surprised at how much I&#8217;m having to relearn already only 5 days into Carter&#8217;s life. Anyway, with all the slacking, I&#8217;m going to try and put a pregnancy worth of cliffnotes into one blog post. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>We did not find out ahead of time whether you were a boy or a girl. I fought this a bit, because I wanted to know if we had to rebuy everything, or rebuy nothing. But after this experience I decided I&#8217;d never want to find out again, and am glad we didn&#8217;t. There is no way I can describe what that moment is like. There&#8217;s nothing else like it. When I saw you were a boy, I lost it and cried as I simultaneously told your mom the news.<\/p>\n<p>Your room is a boring color, I&#8217;m sorry. This is what has to happen when you don&#8217;t find out ahead of time. A light shade of green comparable to maybe the center of a kiwi. But, you&#8217;re in our new house! Your brother Chase got to help me do a little painting. I also dropped a roll of frog tape down our HVAC vent never to be retrieved. In traditional little brother fashion, you get Chase&#8217;s hand me down crib, dresser, clothes, rocker. Sorry in advance for a lifetime of this. I&#8217;ll let you get away with more than Chase to make up for it.<\/p>\n<p>You were alot easier on your mom during birth than Chase was. I think the entirety of your labor was maybe 5 hours, vs over 19 hours for Chase. Your mom did a great job! A few rounds of pushing through contractions and there you were. Your head was perfectly round and you had fuzzy wolfman ears.<\/p>\n<p>Chase has been amazing. He frequently wants to see you, share his toys, hold you, and help with feedings.<br \/>\nChase may have enjoyed your birthday more than we did. He got &#8220;big brother&#8221; presents from everybody.<\/p>\n<p>Some random memories I&#8217;ve kept in my mind wanting to share:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>On our way to the hospital, &#8220;Sweet child O&#8217; mine&#8221; was playing on the radio.<\/li>\n<li>The very first thing you did as they put you on your mommy&#8217;s chest was to squeeze my finger.<\/li>\n<li>You peed on your own face when you were 16 hours old.<\/li>\n<li>You eat like crazy. \u00a0Doctor said &#8220;Yeah anywhere between 20-30 oz&#8221;. \u00a0Well, you eat 40+ every time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>With all that said, the most amazing aspect of this experience is seeing the genesis of a brother&#8217;s relationship. This is something I really hoped for and looked forward to, because I cannot put into words what it means. I am lucky enough to have it with my brother, and I&#8217;m so thankful for that to continue with my sons.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Carter John VanBergen was born on 11\/12\/2013 at 9:20am.
