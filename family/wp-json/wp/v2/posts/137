He frequently communicates with various forms of &#8220;Ooohh&#8221; and &#8220;Cooooh&#8221; and even a pretty good amount of smiling.  We&#8217;ve begun to get a feel for patterns (just as he decides they need to change), and we&#8217;ve even gotten a pretty good hang of the child-rearin&#8217; basics.  It doesn&#8217;t take long to be a professional diaper changer.<\/p>\n<p>Really the only downside, if you can call it that; has been a bit of a struggle for us to figure out a pattern that works for us as a family.  We&#8217;ve tried to manage keeping Chase knowing the difference between night and day, while making sure he gets enough to eat, while making sure that we get a semi-functional amount of sleep.  So, there&#8217;s been some stress and sleep deprivation associated with that.  But, we&#8217;re getting it all figured out &#8211; and by no means do these outweigh the strong upside of this little guy joining our family.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had a pretty busy few weeks lately.  From a baby shower with family\/friends up north, to a nice holiday weekend, and even a weekend visiting grandma and grandpa down south.  All this and the summer is just getting started!  \ud83d\ude42  The shower was really nice, Grandma and Grandpa VB always know how to hold a nice get together with great family, friends, and great food!  It gave Chase a chance to meet most of the family on his dad&#8217;s side, and everyone had a really nice time.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing lately is that Chase has become much more social, we&#8217;ve tried to take pictures and capture some videos showing these moments as you can see below&#8230;  <\/p>\n<p>This video cracks me up &#8211; Leaving a present for mom and dad.
