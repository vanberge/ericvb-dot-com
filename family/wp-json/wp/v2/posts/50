In the meantime, the mom- and dad-to-be are starting to pull things together to change what was the official junk room into a cute, inviting, and oh yeah &#8211; safe &#8211; place for the newest addition to reside.<\/p>\n<p>I thought I&#8217;d take this chance to post a few images (some that are stock, some that are ours) of the things we have for the room so far. We went this week and made a decision on the paint color (Tiggers Tummy to be exact &#8211; a light, but bright yellow) and carpeting for the room. Now it&#8217;s just a matter of pulling it all together.<\/p>\n<p>Also, we get to have another glimpse at the actual Baby Van this coming Wednesday. At my last appointment the doctor felt it would be a good idea to have another ultrasound since I&#8217;m measuring a little small for how far along I am. She seemed to think everything is fine, but they just want to take measurements of the baby to be sure. Both Eric and I are excited for the chance to see our little guy\/gal on the ultrasound again, but also want to ensure everything is okay. Eric&#8217;s hoping to be able to take a video when we go, so we&#8217;ll try to post that. If anything, we should have some photos at least. And, for those who are wondering (the grandma&#8217;s especially :)), we are still not planning to find out the sex.\u00a0 And no, we won&#8217;t have them just tell you.\u00a0 So, look for that post later this week.<\/p>\n<p>Onward to the fun stuff&#8230;images are below.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56\" style=\"width: 230px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Glider.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-56\" title=\"Glider\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Glider.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" srcset=\"http:\/\/https://www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Glider.jpg 220w, http:\/\/https://www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Glider-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The glider we picked - it has a matching ottoman.<\/p><\/div>\n<div id=\"attachment_51\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Crib.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-51\" title=\"Crib\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Crib-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"http:\/\/https://www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Crib-300x168.jpg 300w, http:\/\/https://www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Crib.jpg 448w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-51\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crib we picked out.
