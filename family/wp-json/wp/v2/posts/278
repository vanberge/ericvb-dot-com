This ultimately helps our customers have less downtime &#8211; so to some degree that can be a pro. One of the cons of it, however, means that if I&#8217;m unsure about something I may tend to set it on the backburner and procrastinate it.<\/p>\n<p>A very specific example of this is taking certification tests for IT related technologies. Throughout my career, I&#8217;ve been to training for many enterprise level things: Cisco networking, VMware, various Linux\/Unix, Microsoft Server, etc &#8211; the list goes on and on. But I had <em>never<\/em> taken a test after these trainings to get certified.\u00a0 I would tell myself &#8220;oh my employers don&#8217;t care about the certification, just the knowledge that comes with the training&#8221;\u00a0 but if I am being honest with myself, I avoided the tests because I was scared I&#8217;d fail. I would feel humiliated, disappointed in myself, and that fear of failure made it too easy for me to avoid facing a test.\u00a0 I&#8217;d think about this every year or so, and have this twinge of guilt and remorse; a dark spot on my IT career that I would try not to think about.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2018 and Chase being 8 years old.\u00a0 The cub scouts are having a late nighter at the YMCA which has a couple hours budgeted for swimming.\u00a0 In order to be able to swim the full range of the pool and not be confined to the kiddie section, swimmers have to take a &#8220;test&#8221; to demonstrate their swimming ability to a life guard on staff.\u00a0 The test consisted of treading water for 60 seconds, and then swimming the length of the pool without touching bottom or stopping.\u00a0 I knew without a doubt that Chase could do this after swimming for a couple summers at Grandma&#8217;s house &#8211; but he was less sure of himself.\u00a0 He didn&#8217;t want to take the test, and he was telling me (and himself) he was going to be <em>fine<\/em> in the shallow end of the pool.\u00a0 As I started to talk him through it, at some point my words of advice to him became my own advice as well.\u00a0 &#8220;I know you can pass &#8211; but even if you don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s ok!\u00a0 Try your best and see what happens.\u00a0 Even if you do fail, we&#8217;ll practice and try again&#8221;.\u00a0 Even after a few rounds of this, he remained hesitant and was going to settle for the shallow end.\u00a0 I didnt want that for him.\u00a0 I dont want him to settle.\u00a0 But, that meant I couldn&#8217;t settle for the figurative shallow end either&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I finally said &#8220;you know what &#8211; I know exactly how you feel.\u00a0 I&#8217;m scared to take tests too.\u00a0 I never take them when I should at work because I worry I wont pass&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>It was now clear that Chase has this same personality trait, so it was time for us both to get over this hump together.\u00a0 \u00a0I proposed a deal:\u00a0 If he would try the swim test at the YMCA, I would register for an exam on the latest training I had gone through &#8211; Microsoft&#8217;s Cloud.\u00a0 Once he had me willing to take the plunge with him (puns, puns everywhere), Chase summoned up the courage to try the swim test that night at the YMCA.\u00a0 Of course the kid passed.\u00a0 He treaded water without an issue, and swam his best to get to the end of the pool with an excited grin on his face.\u00a0 I congratulated him, telling him I knew he could do it.\u00a0 Now with his part completed, I was committed.\u00a0 Even if I had to admit to my son that I failed my part, I had made a promise and there was no backing out now.\u00a0 I went ahead and scheduled my exam for implementing Microsoft cloud solutions.<\/p>\n<p>I took it seriously.\u00a0 I did some practice tests, hands on labs, and even studying my practice exams while coming back from a road trip to Mackinac island.\u00a0 I felt prepared, but I was still very nervous when it came to test time.\u00a0 The proctors of these exams take it even more seriously.\u00a0 You&#8217;re monitored on video, and they take all your belongings off your person before you&#8217;re allowed to start the test.\u00a0 You get a notepad and writing utensil for notes&#8230;\u00a0 That&#8217;s it.\u00a0 \u00a0I honed my concentration as much as possible and tried to remember my own advice &#8211; &#8220;It&#8217;s ok if you fail &#8211; but try your best&#8221;.\u00a0 About an hour later, I was done.\u00a0 Before I was even ready to see my score, the electronic system thrusts it at me.\u00a0 <strong>861\/1000 &#8211; RESULT: PASS<\/strong>.\u00a0 \u00a0I was more happy and excited than Chase had been when he&#8217;d passed his respective test, for sure.\u00a0 Although, I guess mine has been over ten years in the making here.\u00a0 And even better for me was how awesome it felt to tell the kid that ended up being <em>MY<\/em> inspiration that neither of us were settling for the shallow end&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To start this story, I need to tell a little bit about myself.
