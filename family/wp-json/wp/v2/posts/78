Before we could even start thinking about the setup, the room needed drywall work (a LOT of drywall work), new paint, and new carpet.<\/p>\n<p>Last weekend I finally sucked it up and &#8220;got &#8216;er done&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I taped the room off, finished up drywall sanding, and prepped my brushes and rollers.  After one long evening, we had one coat of paint up and looking very nice.  The high quality Behr paint we picked was worth every penny:  with the primer mixed in, and my thick painting style &#8211; I <em>almost<\/em> could have gotten away with just one coat&#8230;  But, we bought enough paint for two coats so there was no point in skimping.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, we scheduled the install of our new carpet.  The install went smooth and fast, and the new carpet has made the biggest difference!  BabyVan&#8217;s room had some cheap carpet with thin padding&#8230;  And now it has a nice thick soft pad supporting a much higher quality carpeting.  The light goldish-brown color works very nicely with the warm yellow walls and wood trim of the room.<\/p>\n<p>With two coats of paint, and fresh new carpet, the room was officially ready to start moving into.  We arranged and re-arranged the furniture (and re-arranged a few more times) before we finally got a layout that we both agreed on.  Chris did most of the work on the rest of the aesthetics &#8211; hanging the curtains, finding fabric for home-made (thanks to Cheryl&#8217;s mom!) valances, and laying out all the trimmings and decorations.  My parents came to visit over the weekend and they were very excited to see how the room had come along.  It made me feel pretty proud to get the &#8220;mickeyvb&#8221; seal of approval on my basketball sized drywall patch job, and my painting even turned out a lot better than I expected. Only major things left are to get our glider\/recliner in and for Chris to hang up her animal frames.<\/p>\n<p>Seeing and feeling this room come together sort of makes it set in&#8230;we are really having a baby and it is really going to happen soon!  And being able to work on it together was been a very special and memorable experience for me.   <\/p>\n<p>One last quick note: we had another checkup this week.  Everything&#8217;s going well and the heartbeat still came in at 150.  After next time we start going every week!<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to it more and more every day.  We&#8217;ve taken some pictures of the room, and also done a quick video-tour of it using our Flip camcorder.  Enjoy!<\/p>\n<p><object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/zZhV0_EPe6s&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/zZhV0_EPe6s&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/DSCF1012_resized.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/DSCF1012_resized-e1268106487470.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"DSCF1012_resized\" width=\"500\" height=\"374\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-90\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/DSCF1010_resized.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/DSCF1010_resized-e1268106535263.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"DSCF1010_resized\" width=\"500\" height=\"374\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-88\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/DSCF1009_resized.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/DSCF1009_resized-e1268106581315.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"DSCF1009_resized\" width=\"500\" height=\"374\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-87\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/DSCF1006_resized.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/DSCF1006_resized-e1268106629457.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"DSCF1006_resized\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/DSCF1007_resized.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/DSCF1007_resized-e1268106698524.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"DSCF1007_resized\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/DSCF1005_resized.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/DSCF1005_resized-e1268106877993.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"DSCF1005_resized\" width=\"500\" height=\"374\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-83\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With BabyVan&#8217;s due date inching closer and closer&#8230;we found a pretty significant amount of work in BabyVan&#8217;s room was waiting on me!
