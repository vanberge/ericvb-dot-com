In this short time it has been amazing the way so many different things have come together.  We&#8217;ve had amazing help from friends, the grandparents, and other family in all kinds of different ways.  We&#8217;re so thankful for all the people that surround this family.  For Mom and Dad (just now starting to get used to that!) &#8211;  We&#8217;ve figured out a great pattern in our life.  Mom has a new part time job that works perfectly from a scheduling perspective.  She gets to have her foot in the door as well as spend a great deal of time raising Chase.  We&#8217;ve had to make adjustments along the way with who&#8217;s watching him, when, and how we handle things.  But, everything IS working out very well and we are in a great spot.<\/p>\n<p>As for Chase, he&#8217;s at a really fun age for us.  He&#8217;s gotten very good with his hands; grabbing, reaching and getting a feel for the world.  He&#8217;s also gotten to the point where he can sit by himself for short amounts of time, roll over pretty consistently, and there are even some glimpses of crawling motions in the works (though he still has a way to go; you can tell he&#8217;s trying).  His motor skills seemed to begin appearing out of nowhere and have really developed rapidly.  It&#8217;s been really amazing to see and be a part of.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, with all this adjustment, planning, adapting, and recalibrating of our lives it has been immensely difficult to keep up with the things we should really be focusing on: sharing pictures, videos, and posting about this little guy.  Well, today marks a shift of focus where we make time to organize our hundreds of photos, videos, and share our thoughts and activities that we have going on.
