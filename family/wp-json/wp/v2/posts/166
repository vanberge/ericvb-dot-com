We plowed through his first set of Thanksgiving and Christmas, and it was really nice.<\/p>\n<p>Chase got to spend alot of time with both families throughout the holidays; and he certainly got his fair share of toys and clothes across the board.  There are all kinds of pictures and videos we need to get to work on posting.  It&#8217;s much harder than either of us expected to keep up with the world of a baby.  Between Chase, work, family, friends, and life in general &#8211; there really is not a surplus of free time.<\/p>\n<p>This has been one of the harder areas for me to adjust.  My multitasking has had to improve and I&#8217;ve had to prioritize alot of the things in my life.  Netflix movies now sit for months on end without being watched.  My Xbox gets turned on once or twice a month vs DAILY.  My DVR just keeps accumulating unwatched TV.  This has been a natural change, and been something I&#8217;ve been happy with.  I still try to work in a gaming session and stay up late watching some TV every now and again; but certainly the primary focus of my time and effort is Chase.<\/p>\n<p>The fast pace of the last few months are met only by how quick Chase has begun to change.  It seemed like he began scooting and crawling overnight.  His teeth have appeared out of nowhere.  He is able to hit his xylephone toy in a semi realistic play fashion.  He is really developing quickly and it&#8217;s really fun to see his personality come out.<\/p>\n<p>There is a downside lately, and the poor kid has just been through the ringer as far as being sick.  What started as a fever became diarrhea, then he had a dual ear infection, then he had a sinus infection, then developed a harsh cough for over a month, and finally he has gotten pink-eye.  So hopefully his immune system has seen enough for this winter season and he can start feeling better.<\/p>\n<p>The family life has become routine and we&#8217;re in a good rhythm.  Chase is getting the hang of being a kid while mom\/dad are getting the hang of being parents.  So now that things are all hitting their stride, it&#8217;s time to catch up on documenting all the fun we&#8217;re having!
