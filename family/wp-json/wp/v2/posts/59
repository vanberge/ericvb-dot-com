getting around to posting an update!<\/p>\n<p>Today we were excited to have a second ultrasound &#8211; the premise of seeing how Baby Van\u00a0 has developed and grown has been is something I think we&#8217;ve both looked forward to since the appointment was scheduled.\u00a0 Normally I think people may just get one ultrasound at the 20 week mark; but Chris was measuring slightly below her doctor&#8217;s expectations.\u00a0 So, they just wanted to do another ultrasound and measurements to verify due dates, growth rates, and everything else was still in line.<\/p>\n<p>As expected, everything is indeed fine &#8211; her measurements are on track for our due date and the baby size rates at the 55th percentile.\u00a0 The ultrasound was cool!\u00a0 Baby Van is definitely more developed and has much less free space to move around in.\u00a0 We still didn&#8217;t find out the boy\/girl factor (sorry moms) &#8211; so that will still be a suprise on Baby Van&#8217;s Birthday&#8230;\u00a0 But man it&#8217;s just crazy to me the level of detail you can see on the baby&#8217;s face\/hands\/feet with modern ultrasound technology.\u00a0 Although we weren&#8217;t able to get a 3d rendering this time due to lack of\u00a0 free space and positioning.<\/p>\n<p>After the ultrasound, final checks with the doc revealed normal heartbeats, etc &#8211; so it seems everything is on track sailing smoothly.<\/p>\n<p>Chris is now coming up to 30 weeks &#8211; so we kick into an appointment every two weeks during this 10 week home stretch&#8230;\u00a0 Man, time sure is flying.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve got a lot of drywall work and painting to do and the clock is ticking a little faster than I&#8217;d like to admit.\u00a0 \ud83d\ude41<\/p>\n<p>The ultrasound technician said that video recording of any ultrasound is prohibited &#8211; she seemed like she wouldn&#8217;t have been to much of a problem to convince otherwise (since she thought my Flip was a cell phone) but I decided I would follow established procedures.\u00a0 So, bummer &#8211; no video.\u00a0 Blah blah blah &#8211; enough talky.\u00a0 Here are the ultrasound pics!<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Baby-Van-Profile1-0210.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65\" title=\"Baby Van Profile1 0210\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Baby-Van-Profile1-0210-e1265829358515.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Van Profile1 0210\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Baby Van Profile1 0210<\/p><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Baby-Van-Profile2-0210.jpg\"><\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Baby-Van-Hands-0210.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64\" title=\"Baby Van Hands 0210\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Baby-Van-Hands-0210-e1265829392753.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Van Hands 0210\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Baby Van Hands 0210<\/p><\/div>\n<div id=\"attachment_63\" style=\"width: 511px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Baby-Van-Feet-0210.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63\" title=\"Baby Van Feet 0210\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Baby-Van-Feet-0210-e1265829423772.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Van Feet 0210\" width=\"501\" height=\"380\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-63\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Baby Van Feet 0210<\/p><\/div>\n<div id=\"attachment_62\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Baby-Van-Face-0210.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62\" title=\"Baby Van Face 0210 - Kinda scary!\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Baby-Van-Face-0210-e1265829465293.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Van Face 0210 - Kinda scary!\" width=\"500\" height=\"385\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-62\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Baby Van Face 0210 - Kinda scary!<\/p><\/div>\n<div id=\"attachment_61\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Baby-Van-Profile2-0210-e1265829292391.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-61\" title=\"Baby Van Profile2 0210\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Baby-Van-Profile2-0210-e1265829292391.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Van Profile2 0210\" width=\"500\" height=\"385\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-61\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Baby Van Profile2 0210<\/p><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finally &#8220;Dad&#8221;
