I didn\u2019t realize how true this is until I was sitting in Chase\u2019s room looking at a whiteboard where we wrote his feeding times when he was first born. A year ago we were still getting up at 4:00am to feed him \u2013 and now we have a little man on our hands. Even through the sleep deprivation, we somehow managed to successfully make it through the first year. Although we have not successfully kept up with our website updates J<\/p>\n<p>A lot has happened recently, so I\u2019ll do my best to do a rundown of events.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>First Birthday Party<\/em><\/strong> \u2013 in April we had a firetruck-themed birthday party for Chase. We had lots of family and friends that helped us celebrate the day. Chase would have been happy with just balloons \u2013 he had no interest in smooshing his cake or opening presents \u2013 he just liked running around the room until he was pooped out. But, the party was fun and we are grateful for all the love he was shown.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Walking &#8211; <\/em><\/strong> On a spur of the moment one Wednesday evening, Chase decided it was time to walk. Either we don\u2019t do things fast enough for him, or he was so set on running after Molly, he went for it. Neither Eric or I were prepared for it so it was a huge surprise. Once he figured it out, it didn\u2019t take long for him to master it. Now poor Kitt and Molly have discovered they have to move much faster to get out of his way. And poor Mom and Dad have discovered how much stuff has to be moved to higher ground. So far the only major catastrophe was a cup of coffee that got spilled on the new carpet \u2013 we learned very quickly after that!<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Ears <\/em><\/strong>\u2013 Seems like this has been a common theme at our house. After a round of ear infections in December, we thought we had things under control. But in April we got hit with them again \u2013 this time we went through 5 rounds of antibiotics. After the last round was finished, and after a slight run in with a double-dose of very strong antibiotics (talk about freaked out parents!), we decided that ear tubes were the way to go. Although it was tough to know he was going to be on anesthesia, knowing that this would help eliminate the infections was a huge plus. It was a little comical to watch his reaction after he was given the first dose of meds to calm him down (he acted spacey like I would after a night out on the town), and overall the surgery went well. So, now we play the waiting game and hope we don\u2019t have any more ear issues.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Parent\u2019s Vacation Away<\/em><\/strong> \u2013 Just this past week, Eric and I took our first long vacation since having Chase. We left him with Grandma and Grandpa V. Knowing he was in good hands made it easy to relax, but it was still an odd feeling to not be chasing him around. Eric and I had a great time with a group of friends down on a houseboat in Tennessee, and only called home twice in the 6 days we were away from Chase. It was a little heartbreaking when Chase came home on Sunday and was less than enthused to see either of us. Apparently, time at Grandma and Grandpa\u2019s was way more fun \u2013 I think he was ready to go back with them!<\/p>\n<p>When it comes down to it, this has been an amazing year all around. We have gotten to watch Chase grow from a newborn, to a baby, to an infant, and now into a very inquisitive toddler. We have also learned a heck of a lot about being parents. Even with stumbles along the way, I think we have fared pretty well. With Chase walking and the nice weather finally here, we are all getting to enjoy time outside \u2013 so as long as our stumbles don\u2019t result in skinned knees, I\u2019m happy!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Someone told me that when you have kids the days may seem to go slow but the years fly by.
