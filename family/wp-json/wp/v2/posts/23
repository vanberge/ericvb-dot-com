Everything at the appointment was normal, and it didn&#8217;t take long for our doctor to find the heartbeat. It took a couple seconds for us to realize what we were listening too, but once it set in, it was really cool!\u00a0 It seemed like it went all too fast &#8211; I could have sat and listened to that for a long time.
