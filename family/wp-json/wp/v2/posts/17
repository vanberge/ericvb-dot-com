It&#8217;s not ever been bad, but just enough to remind you that food isn&#8217;t always your friend. I&#8217;ve found\u00a0 stuff that continues to taste good, so lately I&#8217;ve been filling up on pretzels, watermelon, grapefruit, and McDonald&#8217;s french fries. \u00a0 According to the lady at the doctor, morning sickness is similar to a hangover; both are based off low blood sugar.\u00a0 So basically while you&#8217;re pregnant you get the same effects of alcohol, just without the fun night before \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;ll take the not feeling well, knowing what&#8217;s on the other end.\u00a0 It still hasn&#8217;t really set in, but as we slowly tell more people it becomes a little more real each day. It&#8217;s crazy to me that we&#8217;ve already known for nearly five weeks &#8211; I feel like we should have the nursery all ready by now. I know both Eric and I are looking forward to the next appointment on October 6th when we can hopefully hear the heartbeat&#8230;at that point I think the reality of the whole situation will be fully realized.\u00a0 Plus, it will give us the assurance that there really is a little being growing, and not just me growing from donuts!<\/p>\n<p>Overall this has been a good experience &#8211; more than anything, I love being able to tell people and seeing how excited they are for us.\u00a0 Nothing beats telling your grandmas that they get to be great grandmas.\u00a0 And as more and more people know, that means the fewer &#8220;fake drinks&#8221; I have to have.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At first glance, you&#8217;re probably thinking &#8220;What?!?
