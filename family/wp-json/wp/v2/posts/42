All this time we&#8217;ve known there was a baby in there, and the ultrasound further confirmed that, but with the movement it&#8217;s a new level of awareness. I know Eric is looking forward to the time when he can feel something too &#8211; although that means I&#8217;m getting jabbed hard enough for an outside person to notice &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m looking forward to that or not!<\/p>\n<p>In general, things seem to be plugging away just fine, and the weeks seem to be flying by. We both realize that we will need to kick into gear after the holidays and start getting our house (and ourselves) baby ready. Slowly the extra room is getting cleaned out and soon will be revamped into a nursery. We&#8217;re coming to terms that we need to tackle picking out baby furniture, and more importantly, entering the wide-world of Babies &#8216;R Us.
