When the Dr. came in he asked Eric and I &#8221; How are the two and a half of you doing?&#8221;\u00a0 Then as we talked, we realized it&#8217;s more like two and three-quarters, of us since Baby Van is a few days from being 32 weeks old. If I go full term that only leaves us 8 more weeks!!<\/p>\n<p>Things are slowly progressing in the baby room. At this point, we&#8217;re just waiting for the carpeting to come in and get installed so we can get the paint up, and get furniture moved into the room. I&#8217;m really hoping that the carpeting being here &#8220;within three weeks&#8221; ends up being less than two so that we can get moving. Although we still have a month before we hit that 36 week point, at which Baby Van would be okay entering the world, I&#8217;m getting nervous that we&#8217;re going to be scrambling. My goal is to have everything set in the room by March 31st. Somehow I think that date will be here before we know it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to start putting stuff in the room and seeing it all come together. We&#8217;ve got lots of things to start putting away, thanks to all our great friends and family who have helped stock us with all kinds of fun baby stuff &#8211; right now the basement looks like Babies R Us has moved in. It really makes Eric and I appreciate how many people care about us \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>Not much else to update right now &#8211; for those who are keeping track, the heartbeat today was right around 140.\u00a0 We&#8217;ve mostly been in the 150s, with one other time where it was 136. So, basically Baby Van likes to keep us all guessing.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, some more baby bump photos &#8211; the little guy\/gal had definitely expanded his or her living quarters!<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/portrait32_weeks.jpg\"><br \/>\n<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/portrait32_weeks.jpg\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/portrait32_weeks.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-72\" title=\"32 Weeks\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/portrait32_weeks-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/https://www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/portrait32_weeks-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/https://www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/portrait32_weeks-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/bump_32weeks.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-73\" title=\"32 Weeks\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/bump_32weeks-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"http:\/\/https://www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/bump_32weeks-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/https://www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/bump_32weeks-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today we had our next check-up appointment.\u00a0 We&#8217;re at the point where we go every two weeks, so time is really starting to fly.
