But at the same time, I can&#8217;t believe pictures of him when he was an infant; that he was ever that small. \u00a0I don&#8217;t want him to grow up, yet I look forward to playing catch, teaching him to drive, and watching him become a man. \u00a0I don&#8217;t want to waste every minute worrying about getting out a camera instead of enjoying precious moments, but I want to remember every single thing. \u00a0I worry about having to share the amazing bond I have with him when his future brother\/sister comes, but I want him to know what it is to be a big brother and to have the opportunity for the friendship like I have with my brother.<\/p>\n<p>I think it comes down to the realization that I&#8217;ll never get enough of this. \u00a0Chase&#8217;s childhood. \u00a0Being a dad with him at this age. \u00a0No matter how much time I spend doing anything with him, it will never be enough. \u00a0I&#8217;ll still miss it when it&#8217;s over, even if I was sick of it while it was happening (&#8220;Oh my gosh you seriously want to read the &#8216;scary&#8217; troll book AGAIN!?&#8221;). \u00a0So, I can&#8217;t worry about it. \u00a0I just need to enjoy it while it lasts, and balance it as much as possible with the rest of the filler that fills in the gaps of life.<\/p>\n<p>Some fun brainstorming bullets that I don&#8217;t want to forget<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You always say &#8220;oot&#8221; (Like foot without the f) instead of &#8220;ate&#8221;. \u00a0&#8220;I oot it all gone!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>The term &#8220;last night&#8221; means anything that ever happened in the past. \u00a0Yes, you did have a birthday last night &#8212; like 3 months ago.<\/li>\n<li>You always want to take the highway when we drive somewhere. \u00a0You know the terms M6 and 131, but you mix them up depending on if we are going to\/from home. \u00a0You correct me when I correct you. \u00a0&#8220;No this is M6&#8243;&#8230;.<\/li>\n<li>You like to tackle me at a full sprint, mom does not like this so much.<\/li>\n<li>You mix up syllables in &#8220;forgot&#8221;; &#8220;Daddy, we &#8216;got for&#8217; Buzz light year at home!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Your old bike is too small but you don&#8217;t really like your new bike yet because you can&#8217;t pedal it backwards, as those are brakes now instead of reverse<\/li>\n<li>You tripped over your stool today in the bathroom and bumped your chin on the toilet. \u00a0You insisted on a Lightning Mcqueen bandaid that looked like a football chinstrap on you.<\/li>\n<li>You like the Deftones.
