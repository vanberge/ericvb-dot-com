This is certainly the toughest part in the early stages of a kid&#8217;s life &#8211; even if only from the perspective of the parent. On one hand, families must work to provide income which pays for a home, food, and clothing; while on the other it can be difficult to think about being away from your kids for so long at a time. The baby probably doesn&#8217;t even notice a difference, but Mom and Dad can sometimes feel a sense of guilt.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve found that the right daycare helps this immensely. We have found one that we feel very comfortable with, have gotten to know the staff, and overall view it as a very positive experience vs a negative one. This trend should definitely continue now that we&#8217;re throwing a 2nd kid their way, even if it may not feel like it initially.<\/p>\n<p>Even though I told myself this repeatedly and continued to reassure myself, I decided to take a &#8220;Dad week&#8221; and postpone Carter&#8217;s daycare start date. So I put in for some PTO and am playing &#8220;Stay at home dad&#8221; this week. Even though I&#8217;m only on the 2nd day of this, I&#8217;m already very glad I did it. These first 3 months are just a total blur. Visiting alot of people, people visiting us, making sure to help Chase understand and learn the transition, and really just the family life in general. During that time, Carter has definitely developed a special bond with his mom. I struggle to soothe him repeatedly only to see her calm him instantly. At times it can feel frustrating, but then I think to myself I&#8217;m glad that he has that bond with her now. My time will come when it&#8217;s time to drive a stick shift, or to throw a curve ball. So it&#8217;s fine that Mom&#8217;s time to shine is now. But even with that said, my goal with this week was to slow things down a bit and enjoy just being a dad.<\/p>\n<p>Armed with some tips, tricks, and a schedule for eating and napping &#8211; I&#8217;m going to make the most of this week and enjoy focusing on being Carter&#8217;s dad.
