It seems like just yesterday that we were anxiously awaiting his birth, and yet at the same time it seems so long ago.\u00a0 Yet, here I sit on May 9th in absolute awe that I am now a part of the &#8220;mom&#8221; group being honored on this day. Even though I know I am a mom, it is still overwhelming for me to realize that I have a son &#8211; a son who I will shape and watch grow for the rest of my life. There is nothing that I am more thankful for than this little guy sleeping in my arms \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>The first few weeks have been a whirlwind of activity\/emotions\/diaper changes\/etc. No matter how many people you talk to or books you read, nobody can truly prepare you for what parenthood brings. It is the most wonderful thing in world and also the hardest thing I&#8217;ve ever done. Each day you hope that you do everything just right to ensure that your child thrives as best as possible and that you don&#8217;t do anything that will impact them 20 years down the road. Did I feed them enough? Did I feed them too much? Why is he making that noise? Why isn&#8217;t he making any noise?\u00a0 Is that smell coming from my little guy?\u00a0 How in the world did my kid create that smell?<\/p>\n<p>For me this time has been enjoyable, but also a big adjustment. I&#8217;m such a schedule\/task oriented person that Chase is slowly teaching me how to go with the flow and that no matter how much you prepare or plan, you have to be flexible and go with whatever schedule he needs right now. As his dad can attest &#8211; getting me to change is not an easy task!\u00a0 But slowly, I am learning that it&#8217;s okay to just sit back, relax, and enjoy watching &#8220;Let&#8217;s Make A Deal&#8221; everyday at 10:00am. And that if the dishes aren&#8217;t done or the laundry piles up, nobody is going to worry about it. All that matters right now is that Chase is happy, healthy, and thriving.\u00a0 And he is all of those for sure.<\/p>\n<p>At his two week appointment, he had already gained back the weight he lost the first week and then some, and now two weeks later, he&#8217;s still growing like a weed. He no longer fits in his newborn onesies, and is getting stronger by the day it seems. He loves to lift his head, look around, and is starting to notice his hands. He has his own little noises (and yes, he does snore like dad) and even though we haven&#8217;t gotten a real smile yet, the gas smiles are still worth it.<\/p>\n<p>He has gotten to meet much of his family and has spent weekends at both grandparent&#8217;s houses. The best part about a new baby is that everything becomes their first.\u00a0 Their first trip to the grocery store, the first bath, and today, his first trip to a Chinese restaurant. This of course included his first fortune from his first fortune cookie &#8211; &#8220;You will run into an old friend soon.&#8221;\u00a0 With less than a full month under his belt, I&#8217;m not sure what old friends he has, but I guess we&#8217;ll see them soon!<\/p>\n<p>This month would have not been as enjoyable or manageable without the support of all of our friends and family who have provided support, advice, and great food &#8211; so I need to send a huge THANK YOU to everybody who has been there for us. It makes both Eric and I feel so grateful to have so many people who care about us, and now Chase too. And a very special thank you to both grandma&#8217;s who are celebrating their first grandmother&#8217;s day!<\/p>\n<p>I could go on and on (and on and on) about all that&#8217;s happened in the past few weeks, but I think the following photos are a way to sum them up.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_133\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/P1010341-e1273492781679.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-133\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-133\" title=\"Our First Official Family Photo\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/P1010341-e1273492781679.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-133\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our First Official Family Photo<\/p><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/P1010341.jpg\"><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_130\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/DSCF1020_0009.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-130\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-130\" title=\"DSCF1020_0009\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/DSCF1020_0009-e1273492936841.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-130\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Close-up the First Week<\/p><\/div>\n<div id=\"attachment_132\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/DSCF1042.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-132\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-132\" title=\"DSCF1042\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/DSCF1042-e1273492977236.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-132\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Posing During Tummy Time<\/p><\/div>\n<div id=\"attachment_131\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/DSCF1040.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-131\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-131\" title=\"DSCF1040\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ericvb.com\/family\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/DSCF1040-e1273493016518.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-131\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hanging Out with Molly<\/p><\/div>\n<p><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One month ago at this time, the first signs (ie. contractions) of Chase entering the world began.
