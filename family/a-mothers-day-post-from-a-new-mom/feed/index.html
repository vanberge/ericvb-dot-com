					<description><![CDATA[Chris, you really have a way with words.  Your post brought tears to my eyes.
You and Eric are both doing such a wonderful job adjusting to the beautiful bundle of joy.  I love Chase&#039;s &quot;gas&quot; smiles!  I have a couple of pictures of them.  
I know how wonderful it is to join the Mom&#039;s club.  But the grandmother club is pretty awesome.  Thank you for making me a member!
Enjoy motherhood...the time goes by so quickly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was a beautiful post.  You and Eric are wonderful at being a mom and dad!  Chase is so lucky to have you as his parents, just like you are lucky to have him as your son.  You are an awesome family unit! 

 I am proud to be Grandma Johnson to Chase.  I love holding him, talking to him, and just watching him!  He lights up when he hears his mom and dad talk!  I can&#039;t wait for that first smile either!

Thank you for sharing him with me and letting me me a part of his life.  I look forward to all the visits he will make to our house and my visits to his!]]></description>
