					<description><![CDATA[I was going to buy golf clubs but I stumbed upon some.  I see some lawn furniture in my future soon as well.  Tech/fun stuff I plan on getting a RAM upgrade before Leopard comes out.  I also would like to get a 20 inch wide monitor to go along with my imac and at least 750gb-1tb of external HD space.

					<description><![CDATA[Vanlandw, the problem is not ubuntu.  I can&#039;t even use my dvd drive to boot to a cd / dvd.  

Chousey pants, how many I.T. people work at your place?  Just out of sheer curiosity.

Vanbergs, you are a good human.]]></description>

Unfortunetly we can&#039;t let it be fully automatic as we have a ton of specialized apps that always get broke with whatever harmless update, so there&#039;s still a lot of manual approving of updates and what not. But it&#039;s still awesome. WSUS3 or whatever is coming out soon and promises to be even better.]]></description>
