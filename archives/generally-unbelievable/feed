					<description><![CDATA[jja - you are kind of correct... they support the newer WPA encryption stuff, and suse has the nicest wireless tools.  

However, its package management system is dogshit &quot;Yast&quot;. Fedora has Yum, and ubuntu has apt... those are both awesome.  Also, i tried suse 10 and 10.1, both run like absolute crap on my laptop for some reason.  

Russellteee - gg..  wait awhile because fedora core 6 comes out soon. right now it is in beta 3.

Vanlandw... of course i got it to work. i&#039;m vanberge.]]></description>
