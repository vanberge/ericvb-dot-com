					<description><![CDATA[Oddly enough, starting this week, I&#039;ve been dressing up more.   I worked from home for my last job, which meant that when I didn&#039;t work from a coffee shop, &#039;dressing up&#039; was actually putting on pajamas. (Conference calls in your underpants:  enjoyable).  

My current job allows me to interact with more people (I have a desk an office, several mousetraps about my desk, etc) but nobody in the &quot;SysAdmin&quot; department dresses up. Well, now I kinda do.  The best dressed I&#039;ve been so far was khakis and a nice long-sleeved shirt.  I settled for long-sleeved shirts and jeans the rest of this week, but I don&#039;t mind dressing up more.  It&#039;d help if they didn&#039;t keep the office around 80 degrees Fahrenheit...

I am far less professional than you. But I also live in Alaska.  We have dogsleds and beard contests.  By simply not smelling like fish, I put myself above most Alaskans.]]></description>
