					<description><![CDATA[Your trip sounds amazing and well deserved. 

It&#039;s kinda cool to just &quot;brb&quot; the computer and phones for awhile. Like last night I got home from work at 8p. I was so tired I just fell asleep in my car in the parking lot for two hours. Got inside my house and my internet was down. So it was like 17 hours of no connectivity and even though it was kinda &quot;forced&quot; it was kinda nice to just be invisible to the world. 

Regardless you are a good man vanberge thank you for sharing a piece of your trip with all of us.
