					<description><![CDATA[Vanlandw,
It is well worth it honestly.  It&#039;s such a good album.

They are epic.

I didn&#039;t like it at first, but after a couple listens it was just awesome and I couldn&#039;t stop]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This would be pretty much an impossible list for me. My favorite albums seem to always change mostly to the newest stuff I like. An &quot;impact&quot; type album would pretty much be all comprised of music I listened to in high school in college. My favorite stuff now is the fastest and most furious music I can run to. 

Of the albums you listed 2pac – All Eyez on Me is pretty much a bonified classic to me I could always listen to songs off that and enjoy it I&#039;m glad we have a similar taste. 

I still need to check out Mutiny Within one of these days.
