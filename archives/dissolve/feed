					<description><![CDATA[I am glad you have discovered the true epic nature of Dissolve.  I&#039;ve had both Drist CD&#039;s for going on two years now, and they are still my most listened-to band.

					<description><![CDATA[Vanberge that is a good track.  Drist has some badass songs I need to listen to their first CD a few more times.

When I think about if if I had to pick a &quot;favorite song&quot; I would have to pick &quot;Disturbed - I&#039;m Alive&quot;. 

&quot;I&#039;m Alive&quot; embodies everything that is vanhood. Everytime I listen to that song I think of my fellow vans and how badass we are in every regard. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7MjG3OX29U

I cannot think of a song that has more meaning the &quot;I&#039;m Alive&quot;.

Danger, then, cannot be considered
I rage again, dispelling my anger
Where do I begin?
The choices are endless
My art, my redemption, my only salvation
I carry the gift that I have been blessed with
My soul is adrift in notions of madness
Repairing the rift that you have created
I am not alone, brothers, give me your arms now

Absolute unprotected vanhood at it&#039;s finest...everybody is against us and nobody understands us....together united we are undefeatable...

I love you vanberge
