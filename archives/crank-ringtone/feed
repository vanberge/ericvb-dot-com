					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a cool ringtone. 

I&#039;ve been using mostly video game rings for me... I have some from portal, Mario, Zelda, etc, and people usually like &#039;em, or at least, aren&#039;t too bothered by them.

They are here: http://www.mtaonline.net/~adambultman/rings/

(&quot;youstupidjerk.mp3&quot; is from Howard Stern&#039;s &quot;Private Parts&quot;, and is kind of a funny message arrived type of jingle..)]]></description>
