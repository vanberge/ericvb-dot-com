					<description><![CDATA[I was talking to vanbergs about your creation here is some constructive crit.  

1) Bulk buy?  Your going to have a hard time getting people to pay $100 dollars for a weekend.  Maybe you could sell 5 business days and give weekends free as part of a deal? $500 for seven days straight or $500 for five chosen days and two weekend days free? At least to start that could be a good idea.

2)You could try selling the idea of &quot;Owning a piece of the Internet&quot;. I was thinking rather then just selling the idea of advertising you could sell the idea of putting things up like RIP&#039;s or &quot;will you marry&quot; me type things. People who don&#039;t know much about the internet or want to bring attention to something or something could buy into the idea of buying the front page for a day

3) RSS Feed for &quot;today&#039;s owner&quot;.

4) Turn on comments for blog posts

I&#039;m going to add a link to vanlandw.com and write a post about the page also I will put a note in the BC fourms to check out your new venture. You are doing a great job!

Vanlandw your support would be much appreciated.  Currently p4p is getting more hits than my new site.  :-)

I did submit it to digg, and a couple people dug it already.  Maybe that will help!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the site.  Having a blog just for the page was a good idea.  You should add a RSS feed for the daily owner. 

If you need some help let me know.  When you get things more to your liking I can make a post on my site and put maybe a link on the BC forums or something.  Maybe get the word out on the social network sites? 

Regardless you are vanberge four and you never know unless you try gg!]]></description>
