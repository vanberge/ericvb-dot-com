					<description><![CDATA[I was once a heavy distance rider. had a few Trek road bikes and a Gitane Super Corsa. About 20 years ago

I started looking for  bike that would accommodate my need for performance, age, lack of riding and budget. 

I cannot stay off of the Wingra. It is really a great bike for me. It is a little hard on the rear at first but it passes. Then it is enjoyable. I am gonna start looking for a road bike soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wish I worked 4 miles from home. Alas, it used to be 11  miles - abit of a trek - but I got moved to another office, about 22-24 miles away.  Too far to ride, period.

Good work with a bike - you&#039;ll have fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought the picture of vanberge sitting on the whale raft would be funny.  Just imagine vanberge wearing a homosexual bathing suit tight upon his manhood all the while riding a bike.

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I bought a speedo/odometer&quot;

The thought of you wearing a speedo while checking how fast you are currently riding your bicycle is providing me with severe mental anguish and rampant physiological responses that are simply frightening and unmanageable.]]></description>
