					<description><![CDATA[I know how you feel, vanberge.  I&#039;ve managed to quiet the &#039;college&#039; side of my brain (except for the part of my brain that likes beer) but it&#039;s still the case that I don&#039;t want to be doing work all the time.  I have a laundry list of things to do too, but in order to get it done, I&#039;d have to work from the time I got off work, to the time I went to bed, every day, for a year.

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s all about a good balance. There is NEVER enough time really to do everything you want to do.  Case in point I bought Leopard on Friday and I haven&#039;t really finished installing it even yet.  I bought a Wii but it seems everybody else has played it more then I have.  

Priorities do change and as you get older you do need to do more shitty things.  Luckly you have a good wife and you can share those type of responsibilities together to get things done. 

The other thing is that your 27 years old and you have about another 50 on this planet to get these things done.  

You are vanberge...I should clean my cat box but I&#039;m going to make coffee...brb :-P]]></description>
