					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad we ended up playing FF this year vanberge. Hopefully us both can enjoy the game more this season and avoid frustration over getting our asses handed to us. If you didn&#039;t play in the league I prob wouldn&#039;t have but so far it&#039;s been fun and hopefully I can start the season with a &quot;W&quot; with a defeat of burgetta.]]></description>
