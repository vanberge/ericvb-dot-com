					<description><![CDATA[as in, the Denny&#039;s Breakfast combo??  

I have three solid running backs (and one Tatum Bell) - i&#039;m sure one of them is going to have a good year.

Cedric benson put up decent numbers last year even sharing time with Thomas Jones...  

I&#039;m actually most concerned about Wide receiver now that i think about it.  I don&#039;t have any &quot;Tier 1&quot; receivers.  Larry fitzgerald is close to tier 1 i guess.  Hopefully Furrey picks it up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Those disappointing seasons for your running backs may carry over, vanberge.  It doesn&#039;t look like Arizona or Houston picked up any stand-out blocking talent to make some holes for your backs to plow through.  Also, you&#039;ll want to keep in mind when Chicago and Detroit play each other...you have a lot of players from both teams.  Don&#039;t they meet at least twice in a season?]]></description>
