					<description><![CDATA[ok, so this may be location dependent since the problem i had was due to a different ip range, mine is 208.117.251.x, this is with TWC in NC. to find out you can use firebug and look at the GET on &quot;videoplayback?algorithm=throttle-factor&quot; with domain name something like &quot;r9---sn-p5qlsm7l.c.youtube.com&quot;. however, blocking that range renders every video unplayable, you could block individual ip addresses of slow videos but results of that are inconsistent - sometimes it would switch to a good ip, sometimes it would switch to another bad ip and give up after, and sometimes it would not attempt to switch at all rendering the video unplayable again. i&#039;ve tried both of these methods:
iptables -I FORWARD -s 208.117.251.172/32 -j REJECT
iptables -I FORWARD -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 208.117.251.172/32 -j REJECT]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This sounds like a dream come true.  But, for the life of me, I can&#039;t figure out how to get this to work on a Netgear WNDR3400.  I&#039;m not an idiot, at least I didn&#039;t think I was.  Help!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rene,
Something I&#039;ve been trying out and testing is using REJECT instead of DROP.
Try replacing that and see what you get?

I have not noticed a difference so far; but it was something that Mitch the original author recommended on his site.]]></description>
