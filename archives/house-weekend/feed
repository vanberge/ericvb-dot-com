					<description><![CDATA[I am not trying to adversarial. I am trying to help you out in the long run. :wink:

I should note I have no credit cards. Most of my undergraduate degree was paid for with scholarships, and my currently graduate degree is partial payment now, and 3.5% interest loans that won&#039;t accrue interest until I graduate. 

However, I am glad to you say our guess on my heritage is incorrect. :razz: Although, take into consideration I won&#039;t let you figure it out by process of elimination either. 

Oh, and, HOLY WINDOWS XP BATMAN. This is quite a theme.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Clearly jja leaves comments merely to accomplish conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So i suppose you are waiting to get your &quot;master&#039;s&quot; until you can afford to pay your tuition in one shot then?   because i bet your credit card interest rate is much higher then the one i will get on my mortgage.  As i do work at a bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of 15/30 year - it is better to be putting money into the equity of a home vs renting an apartment.  As if/when i would move, i would have return on that investment, and more than likely the home would sell for more than i currently pay.  where as renting, you just move out, and get &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of your security deposit back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, JJA, you have unknowingly told us your exact heritage with this line of comments -  50% jewish + 50% dutch.    :-P
&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[Well, like I said. If you cannot afford to buy a house in 15-years, you cannot afford to buy a house. Suck it up, and continue to lease until you can. ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m counting two incomes.   :-P

after taxes, home insurance, etc...  a 15 year plan would cost like 1200-1400 dollars a month. 

It&#039;s pretty cut / dry that is not affordable as we each have expensive cars already.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t let them sucker you into the 30-year morgage. You definately want to do the 15-year plan. Try to get your employer to automatically deduct from your check, so you are paying as frequently as possible. You will save your self many thousands of dollars. 

Hell, after the 15-years are up and you are used to living without the money, you can have it automatically deducted into an IRA and be in excellent shape after 30-years instead of just paying off the house.]]></description>
