					<description><![CDATA[For example, my &quot;Metal&quot; station has the following Bands as &quot;seeders&quot;
All that remains, bullet for my valentine, in flames, killswitch engage, mutiny within, shadows fall.

With those seeders I get a pretty good mix of death/thrash metal, metalcore.

So you do have to spend some time and give your stations some TLC; but Pandora makes it pretty easy to do that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Vanlandw,

It picks your username for you based on your email address. I had no control over receiving vanberge5.  :-(

When you start a station with just one band it does get repetitive if you leave it that way.  But as you thumbs up/thumbs down songs it gets better.  You can also &quot;Add Variety&quot; and make it so more bands/songs are the &quot;seeders&quot; for the station.

For me the upgrade was pretty much a necessity because the free account only gives you 40 hours streaming per month.  I was going to run out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[VANBERGE5?

What in the world is that...

I figured lil man would have ended up vanberge5.

I&#039;ve been trying out pandora as well. Not sure for me if it&#039;s worth the upgrade price mostly picking a &quot;band&quot; station plays alot of the same bands but I have found a few new cool bands using it. The ads arn&#039;t horrible as well especially if you have an application installed. 

I might need to what you did and make a genre list rather then a single band list.
