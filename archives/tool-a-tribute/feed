					<description><![CDATA[So I am not as into &quot;angry music&quot; as I used to be, but I saw Tool at DTE (formerly pineknob) back in like&#039;97 or something.  I had never even anything by them.  It was insane.  I LOVED the show, and because of that I still listen to Tool.  Hey, remember when we went to see Korn!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Clearly Tool doesn&#039;t scream constantly for three minute bursts so I&#039;m sure you were quite bored. :-p

I&#039;m not saying I don&#039;t enjoy angry tracks because I do....but I don&#039;t have a problem with long songs that arn&#039;t constantly playing as heavy as possible either.  I do enjoy instrumentals so I&#039;m sure that doesn&#039;t hurt either. :-)

And whats wrong with putting on a good show while playing music. Not every concert is about playing up the the crowd demanding everybody &quot;to jump on 1,2,3&quot; and &quot;sing along with them&quot;.  I have to say I&#039;ve never seen flying contortionists and that was worth the price of admission at least for me.

To each their own.  I think I agree with vanberge on this one :-)

and vanberge hit the nail on the head with russellteee...i couldn&#039;t have said it any better. also you don&#039;t see any of us giving you shit for enjoying Matt Pond PA.:-p]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It was definitely cool to hear Sober at the Lansing show.  At the Van Andel, they were just theatrical for the sake of being theatrical.  Honestly, I almost got a little bored during the third 15-minute instrumental interlude.  Yeah, they&#039;re talented.  I know they aren&#039;t about beating ass constantly, and that&#039;s fine too, I don&#039;t mind that.  But Tool needed to pick it up.  They had a great atmospheric show and quite possibly the worst possible time to hold a concert (9-11).  I guess I just wanted to hear my favorite songs, that&#039;s what it came down to.]]></description>
