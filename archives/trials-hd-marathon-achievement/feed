					<description><![CDATA[I just got Marathon last night after months of effort. I beat COD4 on Veteran a week or two after buying the game. With COD4, you&#039;ve got checkpoints to help maintain momentum, it&#039;s just a matter of time until you get the timing and strategy right and get through the whole thing. The Marathon achievement was a lot more frustrating, spine tingling, and satisfying when I finally got it. GT: briguymaine]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I promise all of you that Trials HD is a harder game to &quot;complete&quot; than beating any CoD on veteran difficulty.  Vanberge should truly be proud of his accomplishment.  While I do enjoy Trials quite a bit (it&#039;s very addictive, simplistic gameplay...kinda like Contra on 2 wheels with the pattern memorization and demanding of utmost concentration, where one failure means your death), I definitely don&#039;t like it enough to try and go through what my brother did.

But you really have to look at the word I chose to place within quotes...&quot;complete.&quot;  Simply &quot;beating&quot; Trials HD isn&#039;t really a possibility, because until you get gold medals on all the events, you cannot reach 100% for the individual groupings (tourneys, etc).

It&#039;s like trying to complete GTA4 with 100% of everything.  Sure, you beat the story mode, but how much time and pain are you willing to sacrifice to get the 100%?

I can tell all of you right now that the hardest game I&#039;ve ever tried to deal with in this type of situation was Contra: Shattered Soldier.  The game mocks you and punishes you for continuing.  Its requirements to allow the player to actually play all the levels and see all the endings are unfathomably difficult.  And, unlike Trials, you can&#039;t really get far enough to see everything the game offers, so as to run through trial &#038; error.  If you make it to the final level/boss ONCE, then that&#039;s the first time you get to be there, so you&#039;ll likely die a lot.  From there, you can&#039;t continue, because you won&#039;t get the full ending.  So then, you have to play another faultless game to make it back to the final level/end boss just to try and memorize the pattern.  Then, and only then, do you get some options of trial &#038; error.

So I will say, yes, the Marathon Achievement is probably more difficult than CoD Veteran, but what happens when a player wants to beat CoD without dying?  Is that more than simply &quot;beating&quot; the game?  Vanberge literally defeated Trials.  He more than &#039;beat&#039; the game, he beat the game designers themselves.

In the end, it comes down to context and what counts as &quot;completing&quot; I guess...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think Vanbergs could make an honest comparison - he has played both MW and Trials HD...

What say you vanbergs - If somebody said to you:  &quot;Would you rather beat Modern Warfare on Veteran; or get the Marathon achievement in Trials&quot; - which would you consider to be a more realistic venture?]]></description>

13,644 tracked gamers have this game (363 have completed it) 

Yeah it&#039;s not &quot;everybody&quot; on XBL but that is a pretty good sample of people obtaining this achievement.

					<description><![CDATA[It is far and away the hardest thing I&#039;ve ever done as it relates to video games...

I wish I could find some hard statistics - i come across forum posts and stuff that talk about it being like 1%, very rare, etc, etc.  But I can&#039;t figure out where to find that stuff.

Thank you very much Vanlandw I was very proud.  

I celebrated by G whoring in Madden 06.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[COD4 is hard but I was horrible at Trials there is no way I would even attempt to try to learn that game.

I am glad you obtained this achievement last night I saw you got it and was going to send you a &quot;GG&quot; message but you were away and something in my heart told me you would boast about your achievement somewhere.

Congrats vanberge you are an Xbox master.

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah I&#039;m going to stick to that wager - The developers re-tooled this achievement because nobody could get it.

They removed some of the harder/expert tracks but that only makes the achievement minutely possible.  

However I am curious - clearly they are both elitists achievements displaying top notch and 99th percentile manhood.]]></description>
