					<description><![CDATA[Jja... the US advanced into the top 16.
They won their initial group over England, Slovenia and Argentina.

They actually went undefeated in the first three games with one win, two draws (and, a couple bad calls resulted in draw).

So, I could hardly say they limped into the bracket.  
:-P

The lack of scoring is what it is.  There are 11 men per team and a gigantic field.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I watched zero seconds of the world cup, and I find the fact that the US team
limped into the bracket only to be immediately eliminated rather pathetic.

The extremely low scoring is also a major turn off]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You should have added a link too the vuvuzela time browser time I shared out...

Although, the vuvuzelas don&#039;t bother me at all....I wonder if that&#039;s because I&#039;ve effectively kill that part of my hearing through loud music, or because I am black.....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dives are horrible it&#039;s the same thing in basketball. Growing up Basketball used to feel like a brutal finesse sport now it&#039;s pretty much bullshit.

I agree with you on stopage of play. Basketball and football are the worst about this and are just flooded with advertisements. I didn&#039;t watch a second of world cup but maybe some time I&#039;ll check out world cup.

The vuvuzelas must be horrible I watched that vuvuzela Doom mod video and it sounds like death in a horn. 

You are a very articulate man brb]]></description>
