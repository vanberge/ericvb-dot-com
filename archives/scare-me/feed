					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Vanberge that Event Horizon didn&#039;t age well.  I watched it again several years ago and thought to myself, &quot;how did this scare me?&quot;  It was pretty scary the first time watching it though.

GG on The Shining, that&#039;s always a good one.  The Exorcist is good as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, I wasn&#039;t scared by Event Horizon at all.  I remember it being really disturbing for the gore, but not much else.  Try Cube( the original one), or maybe the original Night of the Living Dead(although not so much anymore).  Anything by Dario Argento is usually good for atmospheric dread, plus he&#039;s beyond over the top on gore.  Suspira kinda creeped me out in the midddle of the day.  Feast isn&#039;t bad, but it ain&#039;t great either.

Go there.  Admittedly, not all are actually scary, but it&#039;s a good selection.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually kramer is right.  When that movie came out it was awesomely scary. 

I did however re watch it recently - and it hasn&#039;t aged well.  Still a scary movie, but not as bad as I remember when we watched it in college.]]></description>
