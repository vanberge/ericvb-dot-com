					<description><![CDATA[I would say vanbergs&#039;s personally resembles Kate Moss or Mischa Barton but his body frame is quite similar as well.

I don&#039;t really worry about my diet because I cannot really gain weight but I&#039;m glad you are going about losing weight I guess. Hopefully you will still enjoy going out to eat and not become a &quot;health nut&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Clearly vanbergs is a twig... he is built like my grandpa on my mothers side.... i am built like my father.

My father has a much more &#039;masculine&#039;, manly build.  While vanbergs&#039; build is that of kate moss or mischa barton.  :-P]]></description>
