					<description><![CDATA[Jja,

A.  You used ads before:  http://they.misled.us/archives/369  
How can you unsubscribe from my feed for something that you&#039;ve also done.


B.  I&#039;m sorry that RSS is the dominant means of web content ingestion these days. 
Clearly in 2006 when you put ads on your site, actually visiting the site was the prominent means.  I&#039;m sorry that I have embraced RSS by doing something that you also did.


C.  GOOD.  I&#039;LL UNSUBSCRIBE FROM YOURS.
