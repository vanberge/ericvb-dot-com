					<description><![CDATA[Vanlandw,
For U-verse you cannot purchase the gateway.  It&#039;s a 3 dollar rental per month.  It&#039;s a 2-wire 3600 or something.

Back in the day I wanted you to cancel AT&#038;T because I felt like they were dicking you around. 

My installers were awesome and worked literally non stop all day to get me set up with U-verse.  I may upgrade to 12 meg service; it is only an aidditional 5 dollars per month.  But, we&#039;ll give 6 meg a shot for now.

Chousey I also look forward to you saving 50 dollars.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My AT&#038;T non u-verse &quot;Elite&quot; naked DSL 6mb (less then 3 actual) is $45 dollars a month. 

After all you said to me about canceling AT&#038;T I&#039;m hoping you have a better experience then I do.

I&#039;m pist you have double the service for $5 cheaper.

Did they sell you one of those wireless modem/router things? They suck I have one in a box I could have given you.
