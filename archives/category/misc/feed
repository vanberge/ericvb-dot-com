										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some time, it appeared that the dreaded &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems#.22General_Hardware_Failure.22_errors">RRoD</a>&#8221; had overlooked my Xbox 360 console.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve watched as my brother, friends, family members, and co-workers had to send their consoles into Microsoft for warranty repair.  Sometimes even on multiple occasions.  The ruthless crimson-ringed beast seemed to spare no one.  In fact, I&#8217;m almost positive that I do not know a single person that has an early-model Xbox that has not &#8220;red ringed&#8221; at some point.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, as I went to launch my newly downloaded Battle Field 3 beta, my Xbox beeped loudly and froze up.  I powered it off, and powered it back on &#8211; only for it to freeze at the Xbox boot screen animation.  A second power off/on showed me a most unpleasant site framed in a very distinctly reddish hue.  It seemed, much like death itself stalking the cast of a Final Destination movie, that this unmerciful demon of console demise had at last found its misguided way to my Xbox</p>
<p><a href="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_evil-e1317658213222.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1516" title="rrod_evil" src="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_evil-e1317658213222.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="349" srcset="http://www.ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_evil-e1317658213222.jpg 349w, http://www.ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_evil-e1317658213222-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_evil-e1317658213222-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" /></a></p>
<p>Personally, I feel this has been a long time coming.  I&#8217;ve somehow managed to dodge this bullet for years.  Probably the fact that I have the &#8220;2nd printing&#8221; of the Xbox 360 Pro with an HDMI port bought me this extra lease on life, but who can be sure.  After a night&#8217;s rest, the RRoD continued in the morning.  I decided it was time to take corrective actions.  Microsoft extended warranty coverage for this issue for a period of 3 years.  Since I bought my Xbox in November of 2007, I was 11 months past my warranty coverage.  This leaves my 1st option:  Send the console into Microsoft for 100 dollar repair/refurb.</p>
<p>Since I like 100 dollars in my bank account, I did not even consider this option.</p>
<p>My next thought is to replace the console.  I immediately shop on Amazon and Newegg, but I&#8217;m not really enjoying the notion of paying $200 plus for a new Xbox and paying for a data migration kit.</p>
<p>A third option, much more my style, began to creep into my frazzled mind.   &#8220;Why not try to actually try to fix this myself?&#8221;.  I am a fairly technically savvy person with a family history of MacGyvering &#8211; so I saw fit to AT THE VERY LEAST lace up, touch gloves, and slug it out for a few rounds with the RRoD.  I commenced work immediately.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t use a guide to open up my Xbox; but I should have.  I used brute force and a couple of plastic tabs that hold the top plastic bezel in place are now snapped off.  It was difficult to  get this console open my first time, and it probably took me 45 minutes to have the thing completely disassembled to where I had the system board out and all other pieces off to the side.</p>
<p><a href="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_disassembled.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1513" title="rrod_disassembled" src="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_disassembled-e1317658875780-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://www.ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_disassembled-e1317658875780-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_disassembled-e1317658875780-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_disassembled-e1317658875780.jpg 481w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>With everything opened up and my warranty (or, possibility of ever having one) now completely devoid, I started looking at possible fixes.  Both the CPU and GPU heat-sinks seemed firmly attached, so I didn&#8217;t believe that to be my problem.  Overall, the system was pretty clean.  I blew out some of the dust plugging up the fans and heat-sinks overall, but that definitely wasn&#8217;t enough of a backup to cause a RRoD in my opinion.</p>
<p>So, I decided it must be the memory chips on the bottom of the Xbox system board.  These 4 chips sit on the bottom side where no fan/cooling will ever reach them.  Microsoft tried to alleviate this by attaching some chintzy thermal pads, but those things were basically a band aid with some high density foam attached to the chips.</p>
<p>I removed the pads and cleaned the memory chips.  I used <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz0lNJ6JrQ&amp;t=4m18s">this guide</a> to replace those pads with some custom &#8220;penny based&#8221; copper heat sinks.  You take 2 pennies, wrap them together with electrical tape, and stick them onto those 4 memory chips.  From the pic, you can see I have a tube of high-temperature synthetic grease which I layered between the chip and pennies.</p>
<p>The entire process was a pain.  Getting the system back together was harder than taking it apart.  It&#8217;s difficult to get everything to line up correctly while keeping those pennies in place on the chips.  After I got it part-way back together, I test-booted the Xbox only to find that the red ring persisted.  Even worse, this time it seemed to red ring before even powering on the fans.  I took this to mean that I had a short somewhere; and indeed it did seem that the system board was crooked from my penny application.  I adjusted screw tension in several places, and removed screws completely in other places &#8211; and after some finagling I was able to get the system to boot to it&#8217;s &#8220;normal&#8221; red ring where the fans and everything at least had power.</p>
<p>Further research indicated that the RRoD error code may persist even if you have fixed the problem.  The easiest way to clear that error code was to replace it with another error code and/or reset the onboard chips.  The easiest way to do THAT is to simply overheat your Xbox.  Shouldn&#8217;t be too hard, right?  I mean, the thing runs at nuclear temperature even in a ventialted area.  Google reported the &#8220;towel trick&#8221; was the key, and I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avWs4-wD15w">this entertaining guy</a> do said trick &#8211; which apparently means cooking your Xbox for 20-25 minutes.</p>
<p>Since I had the thing apart already, I decided to expedite this baking process by booting it up without the fans installed.  So I turned it on, then wrapped the console in a thick fleece blanket, and about 6 minutes later it completely powered off.  I tried to boot it up again, and I got 2 red rings vs 3 (indicating overheat, yay!).  So, I let it cool off for about 10 minutes before trying again&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_remedied.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1514" title="rrod_remedied" src="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_remedied-e1317660311581.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="440" srcset="http://www.ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_remedied-e1317660311581.jpg 600w, http://www.ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_remedied-e1317660311581-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>It BOOTED!!!  I let it idle for a bit, played some Trials, verified live connectivity, etc etc.  Everything was looking great!  The penny fix in combination with an overheat to clear it out seemed to do the trick for me.</p>
<p>I put the unit back together, and by this point I was very comfortable getting it back together correctly. I tightened all the screws, got all the tabs back in place, buttoned it up completely.</p>
<p>With everything hooked back up; I tested the console for awhile playing various games.  I played Trials.  I played Battlefield 3 beta.  I reviewed my settings and live connectivity again&#8230;   And after 1-2 hours, it was still working fine.</p>
<p>I have continued playing throughout the weekend with 2-3 hours per session; totaling probably 8-10 hours of game play; and I feel like everything is very stable.  No more red rings.  I have done multiple power on/offs, disconnected/reconnected all hardware and storage devices; and at this time I feel very good about my Xbox and its &#8220;Non RRoD&#8221; status.</p>
<p>In fact, everyone in the family does!</p>
<p><a href="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_everybodyshappy.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1515" title="rrod_everybodyshappy" src="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_everybodyshappy.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="523" srcset="http://www.ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_everybodyshappy.jpg 392w, http://www.ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/rrod_everybodyshappy-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /></a></p>
<p>Take that, RRoD&#8230;  I looked through your intimidating vengeful red eye directly into your villainous soul.  After a hard-fought battle, I am confident that on this day,  good has triumphed over evil&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>###UPDATE###</strong><br />
This penny fix was only temporary.  The red-ring of death resurfaced about 10 days later and asked me for a rematch.</p>
<p>This time I pulled out all the stops and researched every possible fix that typically works for the RRoD.  Ultimately, I ended up at 2 main fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacing the X-clamps that hold the heat syncs in place for the GPU and CPU, combined with replacing the thermal paste on the cores/heatsinks</li>
<li>Purchase a heat gun and use it to refresh the solder connections by heating the bottom of the circuit board.</li>
</ul>
<p>I followed this video tutorial pretty much exactly.  He does a great job explaining the work done, and gives exact specs for the hardware that replaces the crappy X-clamps.  I took it one step further and drilled a grid of holes in the top of my Xbox to improve the airflow over top of the heatsinks.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uB2QoJM7p5I?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This work seems to have officially bested the RRoD &#8211; as of now it&#8217;s been operating for about a month without any further issues.  I&#8217;ve also noticed it running much quieter now that I&#8217;ve drilled the holes, so I think that has improved the airflow and makes it so my fans have to do much less work to move the same amount of air.</p>
<p>Your move, RRoD.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve completely embraced &#8220;streaming&#8221; as my primary ingestion path for nearly all media formats for quite some time.</p>
<p>As far as movies go, I&#8217;ve been a member of Netflix since July of 2007.  I haven&#8217;t bought a DVD since.  I&#8217;ve never even considered a Blu-ray player or owning Blue-ray disks.  &#8220;Stream it or die&#8221; is my motto.  From the music side, digital music owns my entire landscape.  I haven&#8217;t bought a physical CD since 2001 when Tool&#8217;s Lateralus came out.  Whether it&#8217;s MP3s in my car or streaming from my smartphone or my computer at work &#8211; I&#8217;ve never looked back at CD&#8217;s and never will.  Overall, I&#8217;ve really just embraced all things the streaming at large: Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, Pandora, Last.fm, Grooveshark, iHeartRadio &#8211; the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Streaming media is certainly in an early stage in its life.  I&#8217;d call it late infancy or early toddler.  Although the adoption rate for streaming has been thrust into popularity by Netflix and others; the media conglomerates that license and allow distribution of this content have been slow to adapt.  This results in only &#8220;some&#8221; content being available for &#8220;some&#8221; time before it expires.  Meanwhile, the services are offered at drastically reduced rates to customers because the media libraries are far from fully stocked.  I&#8217;ll be the first person to admit that the Netflix unlimited streaming plan is worth way more than it&#8217;s 7.99 a month rate.  But quite simply, Netflix can&#8217;t charge much more than that unless they are able to offer new releases and/or a more complete library.</p>
<p>Netflix has started to attempt shaping the industry as it needs to be shaped by increasing the prices on their streaming/DVD combo plans.  Ultimately, this forces most consumers to choose between streaming or DVD rentals by mail &#8211; and I feel that the vast majority of customers choose streaming.  I don&#8217;t fully support this move with such a gaping lack of new and high end releases in their streaming library, and I didn&#8217;t like that they did it in such a &#8220;bulk&#8221; fashion.  But, in reality this is not Netflix&#8217;s fault.  I was originally INFURIATED with the combo plan price increase and the seemingly forced migration to streaming-only.  But the truth is, this is a move that is necessary.</p>
<p>The industry is resisting the adaption of streaming; and it&#8217;s been even further compounded now that Netflix and Starz have been unable to reach an agreement to renew their contract.  But this was all the same with the MP3 era &#8211; it took record companies YEARS to adjust to a digital age.  Looks like the movie studios haven&#8217;t learned anything.  Nobody wants to go pay 12 bucks to see 20 minutes of ads and previews and a movie that they can stream from their home 3 months later at a much cheaper rate without any ad/previews.  People aren&#8217;t going to keep buying 5 editions of the same movie on DVD/Blu-ray (DIRECTOR&#8217;S CUT.  ULTIMATE EXTENDED EDITION.  ULTRA DEATH PERISH EDITION).</p>
<p>Streaming media is changing the movie industry.  The customer holds a lot more of the cards, and at some point you better realize it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a two part post.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1:</strong><br />
First and foremost, the band &#8220;Disturbed&#8221; is apparently going on an indefinite hiatus after they conclude the Rockstar Energy Mayhem festival.  I&#8217;ll be seeing them play in Detroit with mixed emotions.</p>
<p>On one hand, this is a band that has produced alot of very good music.  On the other, they&#8217;ve also been the source of jokes and laughs at cheezy sounding grunts/rahs/suack.  It&#8217;s like their debut album was catchy, but we also made fun of it.  Their song &#8220;Prayer&#8221; changed everything.  It was epic and profound.  No longer the brunt of satire, they carried this respect through Ten Thousand Fists, and through some of Indestructible.  However, my unconditional love and respect for this band certainly ceased with the latest album Asylum.</p>
<p>Somehow Disturbed has come full circle in a bad way.  Back to their laughable and comedic roots, the video for &#8220;Animal&#8221; sealed their fate in my opinion.  It was cheesy and literally laughable to me.  I don&#8217;t really fault Disturbed for this; as I&#8217;m sure writing music and lyrics over a decade has it&#8217;s ups and downs.  I guess I am a little surprised at how far up they were; vs. how low they have come and gone to be.</p>
<p>As Vanlandw honestly and correctly put &#8211; &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s for the better&#8221;.  I think I agree, but it does still effect me to know that I&#8217;m seeing Disturbed on what may very well be their very last tour.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong><br />
I&#8217;m pretty sure I had viral meningitis last week.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not like Blade 2 wins on one or more of these areas. The critics and users alike universally agree by administering a higher rating than Signs on seemingly every possible system. The fact that Russ says Blade 2 is better should alone be enough for any other man to disagree.</p>
<p>That is without mentioning that Signs is a innovative, creative, and attempts to create a level of depth whether or not you agree with the story. Blade II makes itself a cheesy action whore distancing itself completely from the aspects that made the first Blade movie an interesting film. I continue to give solid backing to my stance, where as critics of Signs can seemingly only cite the ending and the water aspects.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ll let vanbergs address that via an email</strong>:</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t understand why some people hate Signs so much. Saying it&#8217;s stupid because aliens come to our planet full of water, when water can hurt them, is in itself stupid. Humans drown in water. Maybe we should fucking move too. The sun burns our skin. We should fire a thousand arrows in the sky at all times of the day to blot out its rays. As for &#8220;swing away&#8221; and the whole concept of fate&#8230;you may not have agreed with its religious tones or method of execution, but it at least added *some* amount of depth to the story and characters.</p>
<p><em>Blade II was so bad and awful, it was a truly remarkable achievement in atrocity.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>And finally I&#8217;ll close with my own synopsis written some time ago:</strong></p>
<p><em>While I don&#8217;t share the same undying love for Signs that I did upon first seeing it&#8230; It at least makes an attempt to tell an original story. Meaning, it&#8217;s not just an &#8220;alien movie&#8221;. The validity and execution of the preacher&#8217;s loss and reclamation of faith can be debated on and on&#8230; I feel it was done &#8220;ok&#8221; and I was able to relate to the story fairly well even though I am not religious.</em></p>
<p>Blade II is a different kind of movie all together. It is all about CGI&#8217;d action sequences, blood, vampire slaying, and sheer Wesley Snipes. But even in that, for what it is, it was cheesy BS. Nowhere near as good or innovative as the first Blade movie. It&#8217;s not a deep movie, it doesn&#8217;t go into a new level or tell an original story. On that alone, Signs is better.</p>
<p>Some may not like the story of Signs. Some may have wanted it to just be an alien movie. But, the point was that it shot for something greater and I don&#8217;t think it was a total failure in doing so. It&#8217;s an innnovative and creative story &#8211; I think that is un-deniable whether or not you like the film. To tell the truth, I actually think the acting in Signs was pretty good as well. From the Culkin kid, to Joaquin Phoenix, and good ol&#8217; Mel G.</p>
<p>I am clearly not alone in my opinion, and clearly I am not wrong.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s problem with Signs is whether or not they like the ending. If you don&#8217;t like the ending, then it seems for most people that ruins the entirety of the film across the board. Whether or not you liked the ending, watch the films in an attempt to appreciate the originalality of the story.</p>
<p><em>With that;<br />
<strong>Signs is better.</strong></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The phenomenon known as &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling">RickRolling</a>&#8221; is certainly nothing new.  Millions have been duped into watching Rick Astley&#8217;s &#8220;Never Gonna Give You Up&#8221;.  And many, like myself, have had it done multiple times.</p>
<p>Some strategies to Rickrolling a would be victim might include</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-specific Youtube link</li>
<li>Use of URL shorteners like Bit.ly or Goo.gl</li>
<li>URL re-direction</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;d like to take the URL re-direction bullet, make it a bit overly technical, and unleash what I am convinced is an undetectable rick roll method.  Prerequisites include an apache web server with mod rewrite (probably do-able with IIS as well, but I am unaware of rewriting URLs in IIS).</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a folder in the root of your web directory.  Name the folder something like &#8220;index.html&#8221;.</li>
<li>Inside that folder, create a file named .htaccess (note the leading dot. Required in the name)</li>
<li>Put the following text inside that .htaccess file:<br />
<code><IfModule mod_rewrite.c><br />
Options +FollowSymLinks<br />
RewriteEngine on<br />
RewriteRule (.*) "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0" [R=301,L]<br />
</IfModule><br />
</code></li>
<li>Now, you can link somebody to http://www.yoursite.com/index.html and they will immediately be forwarded to Rick Astley.</li>
</ul>
<p>I went ahead and implimented this for display purposes here:  <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/yeah.html">http://www.ericvb.com/yeah.html</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been on sort of a gambling kick lately.  I feel a strong urge to play the stock markets and open up an e-trade account.  I feel like registering 20 &#8220;clever&#8221; domain names and then just parking them.  I felt like and already put ads on my website and RSS feed.  And finally, for some unexplainable reason, I decided to throw $50 into a legitimate poker site to see what I could turn that into.</p>
<p>Initially I didn&#8217;t even realize it was still legal to play poker online for real money.  Sites like Full Tilt Poker and Pokerstars.net seemed to only allow play money and give you endless amounts of free chips.  But after a little researching, it seemed like there are real money counterparts to the play sites &#8211; and they are just harder to find because it&#8217;s illegal to advertise.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I felt very safe and legitimate when signing up and putting 50 dollars into my Pokerstars account.  It seems that they have to go through so many more checks and balances of verification than almost any other vendor that deals with money and online transactions.  I made a debit card account credit, and with my 50 dollars at the ready, I jumped in.</p>
<p>I began by playing very low stakes limit hold &#8217;em.  I grinded out an hour or so of very conservative play with 5 and 10 cent blinds.  The average pot size was well under a dollar but this was a perfect means for me to adjust to the fast pace and learn the basics of how the online poker world differs from real life.  The hands and betting take place so fast that you really have to be on the ball and know exactly what your hand is.  After an hour or so, I was up 10 dollars.</p>
<p>This limit table fizzled out and I was proud of going up 10 bucks.  Even so, 10 dollars for an hour of grinding out conservative play was kind of boring.  I went for the 25 and 50 cent limit hold &#8217;em next.  In this table it was amazing to see the difference in play quality.  The 5 and 10 cent games were obviously noobs cutting their teeth to online poker and it was easy for me to keep a positive bankroll moving.  But even this small jump to the next level brought a significant difficulty jump.  I was forced to play a bit more &#8220;loose&#8221; because I noticed a few consistent betters could take down every pot.  My quick adaptation of playing somewhat loose kept me in the black, and I had turned my 50 dollars into 67 dollars by the next 30-45 minutes.</p>
<p>After feeling confident and getting the hang of it, I made a pretty big mistake that cost me alot of money.  I ended up making a Ace-5 straight, and I had decided to bet that hand no matter how high the pot went.   Well, it was a 4 player pot and everybody kept raising each other.  As the hand concluded, I did oust two others, but there was a player that landed a 3-7 straight.  For some reason, I had the feeling that having an Ace in my straight made it unbeatable (as it would have been in a flush, for example).  But, when your Ace is the low card; a higher straight will beat yours.  So, the pot went to the player with the 3-7 straight.  A couple small pot losses after this big one, and I could tell I was going down hill fast.  My 60 plus dollars was now 37 and I had to force myself to quit.</p>
<p>I take away a very large positive here even though I ended up down 13 bucks on the night.  And that is the fact that I was in the black for nearly 2 hours of solid play.  And, the only reason I went into the red was because of my own mistake and not fully grasping the value of my hand compared to potential hands on the table.  This tells me that if I don&#8217;t make stupid mistakes, I can most likely keep it in the black.</p>
<p>With last night in the books, I&#8217;ll see what happens as we move forward.  Hopefully and in all likelihood I can grind my 37 dollars back up to the 50 range pretty quickly.  But, who knows &#8211; I may lose the rest of my bankroll tonight.  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />   And if that happens, we&#8217;ll call the experiment over with.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve spent years dealing with Comcast.  I&#8217;ve used them for TV and Internet for the better part of 10 years.  Throughout this time, I&#8217;ve dealt with increasing prices, some fairly despicable customer service, and overall a lack of consumer competence on their part.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had any experience with Comcast to rival the level of <a href="http://vanlandw.com/?s=AT%26T">Vanlandw&#8217;s AT&#038;T travesty</a>, BUT their continuously ass-holish persona accompanied by ever-increasing pricing structure have finally become too much for me to bear.  For example, I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve called for support and ended up with them trying to sell me a triple play bundle with home phone service.  Inherently frustrating, I must admit that I fully enjoyed explaining to the representative that I use Skype with a VoIP USB adapter as my home phone, and it is 32 dollars annually for unlimited calling.</p>
<p>Anyways&#8230; The event to kick off &#8220;operation Comcast BRB&#8221; was my wonderful wife purchasing me a new 50 inch plasma TV.  Such a television commands a respectable television service to accompany it.  As I began looking at Comcast upgrade options, I quickly realized that the digital starter package was way more than I even wanted to consider paying (79 a month to start, 120 after).  The digital premier package with ~200 channels was even more over-priced; with a 119 dollar promo rate for 6 months followed by a $165 dollar fee after that.  Seriously.  165 dollars a month.  This is before adding additional HD tuners or DVR.</p>
<p><strong>The Switch</strong><br />
I knew it was time to make a change, and this had been a long time coming.  First and most importantly, I searched for a new television provider.  I explored Dish Network, Direct TV, and U-verse.  U-verse was most intriguing because I saw them as the likely successor as my internet provider.  But, after pricing out package and options I decided on Dish Network.  It was hard to pass up.  Dish has offered a deal including free HD for life, 15 dollars off for a year, and a wonderful co-worker (chouse) giving me a 50 dollar gift card to dish.  Called, ordered, scheduled.  120 channels with HD and a DVR for literally 32 dollars a month.</p>
<p>Dish obviously doesn&#8217;t offer internet, so that was my next item to tackle.  Options here were fairly limited, and there was never really any other consideration aside from AT&#038;T U-verse.  My Comcast speeds had always been amazing.  I would regularly test at between 20 and 30 megs download speed; so this did make the switch a bit more difficult for me, but Comcast&#8217;s medium level service for Internet starts at 59.99 monthly.  They offered me an option to downgrade to DSL speed and still pay 44.99; but there was no chance of this rancid company staying in my future monthly budget.  I called, ordered, scheduled install of AT&#038;T U-verse 6MB connection for 40 dollars a month.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s review.  I was paying approximately $65 a month for fast internet and for the BASIC television from Comcast (like, 15 channels basic).  Any upgrade strategy through them resulted in 100+ dollars easily.</p>
<p>By making a switch to Dish Network and AT&#038;T U-verse, my bill at this point should be somewhere between 80 and 90 dollars.  So, I spend 15-20 dollars more per month; and I receive a drastically improved television service and broadband internet combination.</p>
<p><strong>The Install</strong><br />
My installation experiences for Dish and U-verse were not smooth by any means.  My dish installer was over 3 hours late past our 4 hour block of appointment time.  By the time he had gotten to my home, I had already contacted Dish to complain; and they had credited my account 25 dollars and rescheduled my installation.  Even with that, I was relieved when the installer arrived.  I was so anxious to get dish going.  The install went quickly and painlessly once he got started, and soon I was watching 120+ channels, messing around with my DVR, and basking in High def victory over my red rival Comcast.  As the dish installer left, 1-800-Comcast ensued with a cancellation.  They tried to sell me home phone service and a triple play as I canceled.  This is where I also found that canceling my 17.99 basic television service resulted in my internet price jumping from 44.99 to 59.99.  Comcast, this is precisely why I hate you &#8211; you raise my price by 14.99 after I get rid of a 17.99 TV service?  You are just horrible people; and at this point I couldn&#8217;t WAIT to get U-verse internet and rid my life of your wretched ways.</p>
<p>My AT&#038;T U-verse installer got to my home at around 9.30 am (he had a 9-11 window).  As he got started, he replaced my wiring from the pole to my home, and began wiring to bring the U-verse internet into my home via the Comcast installed coax (which is awesome on multiple accounts).  But, he soon realized he was getting no signal at the pole as he should be.  He continued, made phone calls, left my house, came back with various people.  In all, 4 people were involved, 3 different AT&#038;T vehicles &#8211; one of which was a Bucket truck, and seemingly a neighborhood re-engineering from AT&#038;T&#8217;s perspective.  Finally, at around 6pm that night, I had mother effing internet.</p>
<p>As soon as my installer left, I again dialed 1-800-Comcast to rid myself completely of this vile and disgusting excuse for a service company.  I desperately tried to record the phone call with Google Voice, but for some reason pressing 4 repeatedly would not engage the call recording.  I tried probably 20 times to initiate recording, and there was never a time in my life that I wanted something more than to record that phone call.  It was monumental.  </p>
<p>The representative tried desperately to sell me on a triple play bundle, to plead with me to not cancel in any way possible.  I told her that I&#8217;ve been down this path countless times, and I don&#8217;t want to pay 120 dollars for two services.  She persisted, talked over top of me, and finally I flat out said &#8220;listen, I appreciate what you&#8217;re trying to do here &#8211; but at this point I have Dish Network installed and I&#8217;m on ATT U-verse internet.  Comcast cables arent even hooked up to my home anymore, and I&#8217;m not going to sign up for any services with this company ever again.&#8221;</p>
<p>This ended the call, and I look forward to my final bill.  I will mail a check with it, with the memo &#8220;ef yoo&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>The Review</strong><br />
Dish&#8217;s TV services are awesome.  I had the 120 channels for maybe 4 days before I upgraded myself to the 200+ package.  This increased my bill by 10 dollars (42 dollars now instead of 32) &#8211; but it was a necessary thing to do.  FX, NFL Network, G4, Discovery Health, and BBC America were some must have channels in the 200 package.</p>
<p>Dish&#8217;s DVR functionality is also awesome.  I wired ethernet to the badboy, and it allows me to remotely access and manage my recordings online, or from my ipod touch (the dish network ipod app rocks).  I enjoyed getting used to DVR functionality, and set up recordings for a variety of shows ranging from Jon Stewart&#8217;s daily show to Top Gear and The &#8220;Steve Wilkos&#8221; show&#8230;  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>One thing that did catch me off guard with Dish, was that the recording on the DVR had to use one of my two TV channels.  So, one of the TV&#8217;s hooked to my primary receiver HAS TO display what is being recorded.  This was by no means a deal breaker for me; but was something that I didn&#8217;t expect to happen.  I did find out that you can watch other recordings while the DVR records shows, so that alleviates some of the frustration there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very happy with Dish, and I fully recommend them as a top notch TV service provider.</p>
<p>AT&#038;T U-verse internet is thus far a solid and consistent connection.  I pay for 6 megs, and my speed tests will regularly show up to 5.8/5.9 megs.  So, I&#8217;m getting what I pay for.  On the other hand, the 2Wire 3600 gateway device that they use leaves a bit to be desired.  I&#8217;m not able to customize the DNS and DHCP settings to any degree (much less turn them off like I want to) &#8211; but I&#8217;m still looking at instituting a work-around for that.  I&#8217;ll figure out something.</p>
<p>The 6 meg speed shows itself from my usual Comcast 20+ speeds.  Downloading an iso or torrent at 500-600k is quite a bit different than my 1-2meg sustainable downloads with Comcast.  Saving 40 bucks a month sure puts that in perspective though&#8230;. and there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m ever going back to Comcast.  I hope that company gets oil spilled on it.  And nobody anywhere around them will even consider offering Lemon scented Dawn to them.</p>
<p>GTFO Comcast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we head to the theater to catch a movie on the big screen, we already have to deal with continuously growing ticket prices, massively overpriced food, and talking teenagers with their bejeweled cell phones.  But a much more disturbing trend has been taking place in the last decade or so, a very terrible trend that literally forces me to stay at home and avoid going to movie theaters whenever possible:</p>
<p>Teeny Bopper Takeover.  </p>
<p>This despicable scenario of pre-puberty is not a single faced monster though.  It has several facets.  The first of which being the fact that many more movies center around highschool age characters for their plot lines.  From Tranformers to Twilight, Superbad to Juno &#8211; there is no denying it.  Way too many movies that have come out in the 2000&#8217;s surround lame teenage characters.</p>
<p>The second side of teeny bopper takeover is the actual movies being produced.  Hollywood studios seem to strong arm directors into producing PG-13 rated movies to maximize their profits.  I can understand this to a point; but when DIE HARD 4 comes out as an effing PG-13 movie, something is seriously wrong with the mother effing world.  </p>
<p>Not only do the studios jack the movie up to maximize the teeny bopper profit at the theater, but they then release the &#8220;Director&#8217;s cut&#8221; to DVD/Bluray so that the 18-35 crowd will theoretically spend a few more dollars to see the movie how it should have been theatrically released in the first place.</p>
<p>The Twilight generation is ruining the movie industry for the rest of the world.  I don&#8217;t care if Bella is sad.  I don&#8217;t care if you want to be in a &#8220;wolf pack&#8221; at school.  It&#8217;s effing stupid.  </p>
<p>Well, teenie boppers, The Expendables are going to break you.  The biggest collection of action movie stars ever.  From the classic Stallone/Willis/Lundgren to relative newcomers Statham/Couture/Austin &#8211; The Expendables promises us all everything.</p>
<p>It is my prediction that The Expendables are going to turn the tides of the movie industry.  This movie is made by awesome men, for awesome men.  Even the Old spice guy would approve of its existence.  There&#8217;s no bullshit rating cut here either.  The MPAA rates &#8220;The Expendables&#8221; a solid R with the following description:  &#8220;Rated R for strong action and bloody violence throughout, and for some language&#8221;</p>
<p>This film has seen a fairly significant male call to arms via the internet.  And it seems like MEN around the world are uniting in blood to see this movie on August 13th when it comes out (on my 30th birthday, oddly).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be a success.  It&#8217;s going to own the box office for the weekend and possibly for several weekends.  Hollywood is going to notice, and they will realize how stupid they have been.  How they&#8217;ve been missing out on making this kind of movie for a long, long time.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a man &#8211; then you really need to see The Expendables at least once on August 13th in the theater.</p>
<p>The Trailer ensues<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple months ago, I was blogging about my <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/my-evolution-of-music">exploration into the world of internet radio and streaming music</a>.  I was enthusiastically trying new services and overall just making a push to find a better way to experience music.  I was weighing pros and cons of a few different services over this time, and I&#8217;m happy to emphatically proclaim that <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora radio</a> is by far the best service for me. </p>
<p>I purchased the annual subscription to the premium Pandora One service, and it is possibly the best 36 dollars that I&#8217;ve ever spent.  The premium service grants several enhancements; most important are the ad-free listening, a desktop application, and higher quality audio streams.  For a clean and simple to use service, it&#8217;s amazing what somebody can get from Pandora.  I supremely enjoy the fact that I can queue up an endless stream of music that is specifically tailored to my tastes; all while not having to worry about creating playlists or syncing up any media devices.</p>
<p>Not only has Pandora simplified the way I listen to music, but it&#8217;s drastically expanded my exposure.  Before Pandora, I had very specific musical tastes.  I grew up listening to only a handful of what the music had to offer, and that basically trained me to keep in a &#8220;sheltered&#8221; state of music.  I was overly picky and I never gave anything new a chance.  I didn&#8217;t know that Killswitch Engage&#8217;s song &#8220;Holy Diver&#8221; was a cover of  Dio.  I didn&#8217;t know Dio sang for Black Sabbath.  I didn&#8217;t know or appreciate what Jimi Hendrix could do on a guitar.  I didn&#8217;t enjoy the vintage appeal of bands like Led Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones.  I didn&#8217;t grasp the depth of genre that has come with the last decade or so in music.</p>
<p>In short: Pandora has been my higher education of music.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also noticed how the tech world is adopting Pandora on a much wider scale than I realized.  I was amazed to see that my new Panasonic television has Pandora streaming capabilites.  Heck, Ford is even in the works to <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-10243239-48.html">get Pandora into their Sync platform</a>! (which, I still give massive props to Ford)  Pandora is clearly the frontrunner and defining what streaming radio can be.</p>
<p>Pandora is an awesome service; plain and simple.  You&#8217;re doing yourself a significant injustice if you dont give it a try.  It&#8217;s free, easy, and immensely powerful.  I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys music.  </p>
<p>If anyone is interested, feel free to check out my Pandora stations.  I&#8217;m proud of them and they have become finely tuned to my liking.</p>
