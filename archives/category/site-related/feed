										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve tried to view ericvb.com recently, you may have been met with various error messages at various times instead of my actual website. Terms like &#8220;ACCOUNT SUSPENDED&#8221; or &#8220;500 Server error&#8221; and &#8220;Error establishing a database connection&#8221; have been appearing all too often.</p>
<p>Turns out I have a couple of blog posts that have become fairly popular, and I thought it&#8217;d be interesting to share the story of how my site has had to go from &#8220;just a hobby&#8221; to something a little more enterprise grade.</p>
<p><strong>Houston, we have a problem</strong><br />
I received an email from my hosting provider stating my account had been suspended due to resource abuse.  I then tried to navigate to my site, and I only see &#8220;This account has been suspended&#8221; instead of my site content.  A few emails back and forth with support, and they re-enabled my account to give me a chance to try mitigate the performance issues.  I updated plugins and themes to latest versions, enabled some caching and security plugins, and finally even signed up for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> which has a really nice free content delivery service (more on this later).</p>
<p>Things smoothed out for awhile, but soon my resource usage began to climb again.  CPU and RAM utilization were just crushing the server; and since I was on a shared server configuration, my site was making other people&#8217;s stuff perform poorly.  I had reviewed analytics data and found basically 2 of my posts were the culprits.  One on setting up tabbed ssh for Windows, and another on getting started with the ELK stack for syslogging.  I tried unpublishing those posts for awhile but I still ended up getting suspended 3 separate times. Finally, I had make the decision to move my website to a dedicated server.</p>
<p>The migration to a dedicated server was really pretty easy.  Even fun!  MySQL is a great database and was easy to backup/restore, and the rest was just copying files.  In the end, my website is better secured thanks to the <a href="http://ithemes.com/security/">iThemes security plugin</a>, as well CloudFlare&#8217;s front end capabilities.</p>
<p>I really can&#8217;t say enough about how happy I am with CloudFlare.  It provides caching, content optimization, and security features.  Their free offering is very capable, and obviously the paid subscriptions give you more features. </p>
<p>Overall, this entire experience has been a great learning opportunity.  Topics I&#8217;ve never even thought about such as content delivery, web caching, and WordPess security are now a focus of mine with this website, and hopefully it results in a better experience for anyone who visits&#8230;</p>

<p>But following the ongoing SOPA and PIPA proposed legislation has me inspired to do my part.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/22/over-40-internet-companies-have-come-out-publicly-against-sopa/">Many strong internet companies</a> are against these bills, and many of them are taking action up to and including <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/wikipedia-blackout-brings-sopa-pipa-issue-forefront-businesses-162801217.html">blacking out their website for a day</a>.</p>
<p>This is a viral protest, and many sites are taking part in this campaign.  Certainly, ericvb.com and its 50 visits per day are merely a drop in an olympic size swimming pool &#8211; but we are all swimming in that pool.</p>
<p>Therefore, tomorrow I will be using <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sopa-blackout/">this handy WordPress plugin</a> to black out my site as well and stand at arms with <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia_anti-SOPA_blackout">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html">reddit</a>, etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&#8217;ve made a couple of subtle tweaks to my theme to fix minor issues that have bugged me for some time.</p>
<p><strong>1: The Completion of Twitter De-integration</strong><br />
First on my list was to button up the exclusion of my Twitter category.  For some time, I&#8217;ve been using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/">Twitter Tools</a> plugin to create weekly digest posts of all my Twitter activity.  I appreciate this functionality quite a lot.  I like being able to search a subject and find my WordPress blog entries AND tweets on the subject.  However, I didn&#8217;t like spamming readers via RSS or pushing down the real content of my site with what I&#8217;d consider &#8220;archival&#8221; content.  Ultimately I wanted to exclude the Twitter category from every possible area except if you actually click on the Twitter header link to get to that category.</p>
<p>Using a couple <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/better-twitter-integration">custom tweaks</a> to my theme&#8217;s functions.php file, I was able to mostly implement this back in 2010.  The Twitter category primarily only shows up if you go the category page.  But, recently I also happened to notice that the single posts have links to the previous post and next post; and unfortunately this loop didn&#8217;t read the standard WordPress query.  The previous/next post links embrace their own functions completely.  As such, these were showing the posts from my Twitter category.  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>With a little research on the functions specific to post navigation, I found it was pretty easy to ditch the Twitter category here as well.</p>
<p>Original code for the previous/next links:<br />
<code>&lt;?php previous_post_link( '%link', '&lt;span&gt;'<br />
. _x( '&amp;larr;', 'Previous post link', 'twentyten' ) . '&lt;/span&gt; %title' ); ?&gt;</code></p>
<p>Updated code for the previous/next links to exclude my Twitter category:<br />
<code>&lt;?php previous_post_link( '%link', '&lt;span&gt;'<br />
. _x( '&amp;larr;', 'Previous post link', 'twentyten' ) . '&lt;/span&gt; %title', FALSE, '28'  ); ?&gt;</code></p>
<p>The FALSE indicates that the next/previous don&#8217;t have to be from the same category, and then the &#8217;28&#8217; is the last variable which is &#8220;excluded_categories&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, the Twitter category now will really only show up if you&#8217;re searching or if you&#8217;re clicking on the Twitter link in the header nav bar.  I love WordPress.</p>
<p><strong>2: Double Sentence Spacing</strong><br />
Next up is the effect of my typing style that I cannot break.  When I&#8217;m done typing a sentence, I hit the spacebar twice.  This is certainly a debated point as to whether single or double sentence spacing is correct &#8211; especially on the internet.  It creates &#8220;rivers&#8221; of white space at times that can be a distraction, and can be a waste of page space and characters in database tables.  Even worse, my theme would display a quirky structure at times by moving that 2nd space onto the leading edge of a new line, hence starting the new line one space indented from the rest of my site.  It looked terrible.</p>
<p>Example of bad spacing, note the clear indent on the 2nd line:<br />
<a href="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/spacing-bad.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1550" title="spacing-bad" src="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/spacing-bad.jpg" alt="Note the clear space indenting the 2nd line" width="259" height="81" /></a></p>
<p>In my opinion, it&#8217;s better to single space.  I just can&#8217;t seem to do it.  I can&#8217;t manage to break that habit.  So, I scoured the internet for ways to make WordPress do it for me.  It didn&#8217;t take long for me to find a simple and easy function to handle this.</p>
<p><code>function remove_spaces($the_content) {<br />
return preg_replace( '/[\p{Z}\s]{2,}/u', ' ', $the_content );<br />
}<br />
add_filter('the_content', 'remove_spaces');</code></p>
<p>I added that code to my theme&#8217;s custom function.php file (the same place where I exclude the Twitter category), and all is well!  Wordpress adjusts my double spaced content into single space and displays it beautifully:<br />
<a href="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/spacing-good.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1549" title="spacing-good" src="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/spacing-good.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="81" /></a></p>
<p>I love WordPress</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/upcoming-changes-to-reader-new-look-new.html">Google announced some big changes</a> to Google Reader.</p>
<p>The overall strategy by Google to unify its services drew them to the conclusion that they have to force all Google Reader users to begin using Google+ to fulfill the social aspect of Reader.  Friending, following others, and commenting on shared items within Reader would now be discontinued&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this really hit me until it actually happened.</p>
<p>As I was greeted with the &#8220;Welcome to the new Reader&#8221; message last week, I finally got a feel for how big this change truly was.  Usually, my first click is to &#8220;People you follow&#8221; when I log into Google Reader.  Well, that&#8217;s now gone.  There&#8217;s no longer a simple way to see shared items, to comment on them, or to get a quick overview of what items my friends are reading.  Instead, I&#8217;m stuck muddling through Google+ posts trying to find a way to make this social world work again.</p>
<p>I just feel completely lost in the new Reader.  The extra clicks/page views necessary to get the same functionality in Google+ make it difficult and inefficient.  I don&#8217;t like the look of the new Reader.  I don&#8217;t like having to go back and forth between 2 different sites to see and comment on shared items.  It&#8217;s just a sad state of affairs.  I&#8217;m sick of companies trying to force customers/users into a model that they obviously don&#8217;t support.</p>
<p>As of yet, there isn&#8217;t a very solid alternative to Google Reader.  I&#8217;ve researched and tested a few, but the social aspect is a key that is missing in nearly every contender.  I&#8217;m looking forward to trying out <a href="http://hivemined.org/">hivemined</a>, which seems to be getting alot of e-buzz as a true Google Reader alternative.  Until then, I&#8217;m struggling to adapt to a new way of doing this.  A significant portion of my friends and my own internet activity was spent inside Google Reader, and at this point we&#8217;re all trying to re-group as the table cloth was pulled out from under us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have taken it upon myself to make some dramatic changes to EricVB.com.</p>
<p>Unordered list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstalled Gallery photo publishing software (I never update it, photos go on FB etc)</li>
<li>Uninstalled all unused plugins</li>
<li>Cleaned out the mysql database.  (dropped ~60 tables of g2_*, and also ALOT of tables created by past plugins.  If you&#8217;re a wordpress dev, don&#8217;t ever have your plugin create tables.  Store an entry in the options table GOSH.</li>
<li>Upgraded lean/cleaned WordPress to 3.2 Beta 1</li>
<li>Upgraded immediately to 3.2 Beta 2 which was just released (svn sw ftw)</li>
<li>Decide on the new default theme called &#8220;twentyeleven&#8221;</li>
<li>Learn about creating a child theme; which is way more awesome than directly editing theme files &#8211; which, I&#8217;ve always done in the past.</li>
<li>Used my child theme to re-add sidebars to single posts and pages, put in Google analytics code, make various css tweaks</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I like the look of the twentyeleven theme.  But there are a couple things that I really do not understand.  First:I dont really understand why they remove the sidebar on pages and on single-post permalinks &#8211; so it took me some work to figure out how to get that back in there and make it look normal (set pages to use the sidebar template; customized css for all .singular content entries).  </p>
<p>Secondly:  I cannot stand the header image size.  The header in the WordPress 3.0 default theme &#8220;twentyten&#8221; was 940 x 188.  This was too large for my taste, but I rolled with it and grew to be OK with it vs re-writing css to skinny it down.  Now, in the 3.2 default theme of twnetyeleven, the header even larger.   1000 x 288.  Seriously.  TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT pixels tall.  That is nearly a third of your screen resolution before you can even see any content.  It&#8217;s literally nothing but ridiculous.  Therefore, I have disabled the header image completely.  If any person responsible for the header image size in the theme &#8220;twentyeleven&#8221;:  I hope your car dies on you tomorrow in gridlock traffic seriously.</p>
<p>Things are certainly still a work in progress&#8230; but I am having fun re-tooling my web presence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The phenomenon known as &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling">RickRolling</a>&#8221; is certainly nothing new.  Millions have been duped into watching Rick Astley&#8217;s &#8220;Never Gonna Give You Up&#8221;.  And many, like myself, have had it done multiple times.</p>
<p>Some strategies to Rickrolling a would be victim might include</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-specific Youtube link</li>
<li>Use of URL shorteners like Bit.ly or Goo.gl</li>
<li>URL re-direction</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;d like to take the URL re-direction bullet, make it a bit overly technical, and unleash what I am convinced is an undetectable rick roll method.  Prerequisites include an apache web server with mod rewrite (probably do-able with IIS as well, but I am unaware of rewriting URLs in IIS).</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a folder in the root of your web directory.  Name the folder something like &#8220;index.html&#8221;.</li>
<li>Inside that folder, create a file named .htaccess (note the leading dot. Required in the name)</li>
<li>Put the following text inside that .htaccess file:<br />
<code><IfModule mod_rewrite.c><br />
Options +FollowSymLinks<br />
RewriteEngine on<br />
RewriteRule (.*) "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0" [R=301,L]<br />
</IfModule><br />
</code></li>
<li>Now, you can link somebody to http://www.yoursite.com/index.html and they will immediately be forwarded to Rick Astley.</li>
</ul>
<p>I went ahead and implimented this for display purposes here:  <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/yeah.html">http://www.ericvb.com/yeah.html</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe a year ago, I did a trial run on some Google ads on my site.  They were up for maybe 6 or 8 months.</p>
<p>My site&#8217;s traffic has gone up pretty significantly since then, and I figured it might be nice to give them another shot.  Therefore I have inconspicuously and tastefully placed a couple ads on my site.  </p>
<p>I also finally took the plunge to creating a feedburner feed for this site.  So I&#8217;ve redirected the RSS traffic to the feedburner feed vs the locally generated WordPress feed.  This obviously allows me to place ads in the RSS feeds which I have clearly done.</p>
<p>I advise all users to never click any of my ads.  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back when I was playing through Grand Theft Auto IV, <a href="http://vanlandw.com">Vanlandw</a> and I were trying very hard to find the sound samples used when the player successfully completed a mission&#8230;</p>
<p>For those that may not know what I&#8217;m talking about:  Depending which mission you were playing in GTA 4, one of three various sound samples would play upon successful completion &#8211; and they were all very catchy, cool sounding clips.  Mainly, our thought was that they would make great ring tones on a mobile phone.</p>
<p>After I had long since given up, Vanlandw did actually manage to find and make one of the sounds into an mp3 ringtone &#8211; for which I give him immense credit.  I&#8217;ve used that very ring tone off and on as my ringer for some time.   Today, I came across a youtube vid that sampled all of the various mission complete sounds (even 2 additional &#8220;sad&#8221; mission ending sounds that I didn&#8217;t think about).  The sampling on the two &#8220;sad&#8221; clips is kinda shaky &#8211; you can hear traffic and footsteps from the game, so I elected not to use those.  But, I decided to use some rip/dub/export awesomeness to get the audio into a usable mp3 format and create a ringer for each different sound clip.   Check them out below, or just click on the &#8220;Files&#8221; tab up above and find them under Ringtones.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/misc/Ringtones/GTA4_miss_comp1.mp3">GTA4 &#8211; Mission Complete tone 1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/misc/Ringtones/GTA4_miss_comp1-double.mp3">GTA4 &#8211; Mission Complete tone 1</a> (double ring)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/misc/Ringtones/GTA4_miss_comp2.mp3">GTA4 &#8211; Mission Complete tone 2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/misc/Ringtones/GTA4_miss_comp3.mp3">GTA4 &#8211; Mission Complete tone 3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>#1 is my fav, I think&#8230;</p>
<p>****Update****<br />
Noticed these ring-tones were very quiet when played on a cell phone &#8211; So I&#8217;ve uploaded amplified versions &#8211; as well as a double ring version of the 1st tone.</p>
<p>YEAH</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I both love and hate the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/">Twitter-Tools plugin</a> for WordPress.</p>
<p>On one hand; I really like how it can integrate Twitter into my blog via both sidebar widget and weekly Twitter digest posts&#8230;  But, on the other hand, I was really starting to feel like these digest posts were cluttering up both my blog and my archives.  Several times recently I have found myself scrolling back through way too many Twitter digest posts in order to get at my ACTUAL blog posts and content that I had written.  Basically, I came to the conclusion that &#8220;I didn&#8217;t like this&#8221; and I had to modify how Twitter integrated with my Blog.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;ve taken the steps necessary to achieve what I believe is the best of both worlds.  I now have weekly Twitter digest post created as usual; but they do not display in my main blog page or in my archives page &#8212; AND you have to specifically navigate to a &#8220;Twitter&#8221; page in order to see them at all.</p>
<p>This was actually a little more challenging for me than I&#8217;d like to admit &#8211; but I&#8217;ll go through the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>First: Exclude the Category</strong><br />
To block out my Twitter category from displaying on my blog and archives, I added the following function to the functions.php file within my theme directory.  The &#8220;-28&#8221; below refers to the corresponding category ID for the Twitter category.  This code made it so all posts within the  &#8220;Twitter&#8221; category are ignored in both my blog page and my archives.</p>
<p>        <code>function exclude_category($query){<br />
        if ($query->is_home) {<br />
        $query->set('cat', '-28');<br />
        }<br />
return $query;<br />
}<br />
add_filter('pre_get_posts', 'exclude_category');</code></p>
<p><strong>Second: Make the Category &#8220;Navigateable&#8221; from the Main Page</strong><br />
The more challenging part for me was figuring out an &#8220;easy&#8221; way to navigate to these Twitter digest posts.  It sounded like a fairly easy thing to do; but I had a surprisingly difficult time with it.</p>
<p>I experimented with some .htacces redirection, and also some plugins that claimed to do exactly what I wanted (but, sucked).  In the end; I chose to just modify my theme&#8217;s main loop logic and save it as a new page template.  I copied the the text from my theme&#8217;s index.php file, and and pasted it into my a file called &#8220;twitter.php&#8221; which I saved as a new page template.  I then replaced the following code:</p>
<p><code>if (have_posts()) :<br />
while (have_posts()) : the_post();</code></p>
<p>With this code:<br />
<code>$recent = new WP_Query();<br />
$recent->query('cat=28');<br />
if ($recent->have_posts()) :<br />
while($recent->have_posts()) : $recent->the_post();</code></p>
<p>This actually worked fairly well, and in retrospect is very easy &#8211; it just took me quite awhile to arrive at this solution!  The final step here was then to add a page called &#8220;Twitter&#8221; via the administration panel; and simply change the page to use this Twitter.php template instead of the default page template.</p>
<p>Voila, a Twitter page that you can navigate to which displays all the weekly digest Twitter posts created automatically by the Twitter Tools plugin.</p>
<p>**** UPDATE ****<br />
Vanlandw had a great recommendation about excluding these Twitter digest posts from my RSS feeds as well.  That was very simple to do&#8230;  My exclude function in the functions.php file in my theme directory now reads as such:<br />
<code>function exclude_category($query){<br />
        if ($query->is_home || $query->is_feed) {<br />
        $query->set('cat', '-28');<br />
        }<br />
return $query;<br />
}</code></p>
<p>And, now the Twitter digest posts are excluded from my RSS feed as well!  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  WordPress and PHP are both awesome.</p>
