										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.braid-game.com">Braid</a> is one of my favorite gaming experiences that I&#8217;ve ever had. This was a bit of a surprise for me, as it doesn&#8217;t fit any of the typical gaming constructs that I find usually appeal to my digital self. It&#8217;s a relatively short, independently developed puzzle game. It&#8217;s difficult to put the experience I had playing this game into words. It was a total immersion for me.</p>
<p>I felt, on some level, like I <em>was</em> Tim (the main character). The wold of Braid provides creative time manipulation techniques, including slowing time and rewinding time, to help you push Tim on his quest to reunite with his lost princess. Jonathan Blow, the creator of this masterpiece, tells a compelling story that really I think any human being can painfully relate to. Who hasn&#8217;t made a mistake and wished they could rewind time and do things differently? The game gives you a chance to experience this. With a storyline that is intentionally vague, your own psyche somehow fills in the gaps of Tim&#8217;s past with your own life experiences. You share his quest with him.  I somehow shared a part in whatever mistakes he made to lose his princess.  </p>
<p>The premise of a lost love and the chance to create a perfect future is something I think the human condition would strive for at any chance. I certainly consider myself a lucky man, and there isn&#8217;t alot I would change about my life. But I have experienced darker times, and I think Tim represented that to me. Myself, rewinding through a dark and lonely portion of life, trying to recreate an ideal.</p>
<p>The puzzle portion of the game cannot be commended enough. I found myself wondering how a human mind could create some of these puzzles. And, on top of conceptualizing them; how they could possibly posses the skills required to turn them into a virtual reality using software development and writing code. I&#8217;m typically a very impatient person. I rarely have the time or calmness to take on a puzzle game. With Braid, I found myself in a paradox. I certainly wanted desperately to solve each puzzle and continue, yet I dreaded the end of the experience. I refused to look up any walkthoughs or online guides and made sure to solve everything on my own. It was somehow a calming and zen-like state of mind trying to move forward through this game.</p>
<p>The game doesn&#8217;t have groundbreaking graphics.  But the soundtrack and art, the overall style of the game, are all fantastic.  Beautifully painted backdrops combined with an audio composition that embodies a strong medley of longing, hope and optimism &#8211; It&#8217;s profound.</p>
<p>I really can&#8217;t believe that an indie game was capable of having this effect on me, and really all I can do is to say &#8220;Thank you&#8221; to Jonathan Blow for providing the world the chance to experience this. If you ever read this, I hope you feel a sense of pride in what you do and how you have managed to truly create a world class gaming experience.</p>
<p>If you like video games, and you have not played Braid &#8211; You should do so immediately.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1/18/2012 was a very interesting day on the Internet.</p>
<p>I was somehow infatuated with what websites were doing to show their opposition and protest to the SOPA and PIPA bills.  I think I liked reddit&#8217;s blackout page the best of anybody that I personally saw, but there was certainly alot of creativity across the board.</p>
<p><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2012/01/sopa-blackout-who-is-joining-the-protest.html">This blog</a> captured many of the screenshots of big players in the blackout day.  They somehow left out my site on that blog, so I&#8217;ll go ahead and share <a href="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Site_Sopa_day.png">what my site looked like</a> with you yesterday.</p>
<p>The most amazing thing, is that I <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/19/tech/sopa-blackouts/index.html?hpt=hp_c2">really</a> <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57361237-281/protests-lead-to-weakening-support-for-protect-ip-sopa/">think</a> <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/amid-internet-blackouts-support-for-anti-piracy-bills-dwindling-in-congress/">this actually</a> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/01/19/internet-blackout-causes-18-senators-to-flee-from-pipa/">worked</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/18/glenn-beck-sopa_n_1214701.html?ref=glenn-beck">Even GLENN BECK is against it</a>!</p>
<p>This social media age has ignited a fight in the common people.  It&#8217;s awesome to see.  From insane corporate strategies [Netflix], to the occupy movements, to protests that literally changed the landscape of countries: A small spark can ignite a firestorm.  </p>
<p>Where the SOPA and PIPA bills will end up remains to be seen, but yesterday was pretty historic.  The Internet bonded together and certainly made an impact on a very key turning point in the information age.</p>
<p>Yesterday was supremely significant, yes, but it&#8217;s certainly not over.  Watch the video.  Share it with friends.  Use the form to contact somebody and tell them how you feel.  Part of the solution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently at work we have been trying to improve communications skills and tactics.  As part of that, we&#8217;ve had to learn and determine our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator">Myers Briggs</a> personality type.  These personality types are widely researched, studied, and considered a very accurate representation of a person&#8217;s traits.</p>
<p>The general idea is that you have to determine your personality traits you have.  For example:  Are you introverted or extroverted?  Do you rely on senses or intuition?  Are you a thinker or a feeler?  etc.</p>
<p>There are various means of self-rating and determining; as well as plenty of <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes1.htm">online test/questionnaires</a> that make an attempt to determine your personality type for you.  When I self-rated, I came out as an &#8220;<a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/ISFJ.html">ISFJ</a>&#8221; &#8211; which I must say is a pretty accurate description of my personality.  See below:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The ISFJ feels a strong sense of responsibility and duty.  They take their responsibilities very seriously, and can be counted on to follow through.  For this reason, people naturally tend to rely on them. The ISFJ has a difficult time saying &#8220;no&#8221; when asked to do something, and may become over-burdened.  In such cases, the ISFJ does not usually express their difficulties to others, because they intensely dislike conflict, and because they tend to place other people&#8217;s needs over their own. The ISFJ needs to learn to identify, value, and express their own needs, if they wish to avoid becoming over-worked and taken for granted.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>However, I was interested to see that I sometimes am rated as an I<strong>N</strong>FJ when I take online tests/questionnaires that determine my personality type for me.  And this personality type does also seem to run quite parallel to mine.  Specifically, one section quite strongly caught my eye:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>INFJs may fantasize about getting revenge on those who victimize the defenseless.  The concept of &#8216;poetic  justice&#8217; is appealing to the INFJ.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>That concept does really ring pretty heavy with me &#8211; as most of my favorite movies and TV shows always seem to have some degree of a revenge/justice theme.  I&#8217;ve even <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/vengeance">blogged about it</a> before.</p>
<p>Whether I&#8217;m an INFJ or an ISFJ I guess doesn&#8217;t really matter that much &#8211; but overall it&#8217;s been an interesting experience of self-reflection to try and determine and label my various personality traits.  It&#8217;s also fun for me to try to guess my friends/family members. So if anyone reading this knows theirs, feel free to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Music has always been a big part of my life.  From my early years recording radio stations to blank cassette tapes, through my Sony Discman and car stereo phases, and onto the digital iPod and streaming of present day.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started to try to determine my top ten list of albums of all time.  Vanbergs and I have had several discussions recently about favorite bands, songs, and various musical debates.  This has sparked me to do some soul searching and survey my life as it currently stands to determine which 10 albums have made the most impact on my life.</p>
<p>Behold the following list with a brief synopsis of MY top 10 albums and why I have chosen them.  Note that they are in no particular order, as that was simply impossible for me to formulate.</p>
<p><strong>Sponge &#8211; Rotting Pinata</strong><br />
The opening guitar riff of &#8220;Plowed&#8221; alone brings this one into consideration immediately.  Sponge has a unique sound mixing harder guitar riffs with punkish uptones and laying down some fairly epic and emotive lyrics to complete the mix.  This album instantly makes me think and feel the better memories of my high school times.  Plowed is by far my favorite track, but there is not a bad song on this album.  Molly (16 Candles), Rainin&#8217;, and Drownin&#8217; complete this masterfully diverse album that is always going to hold a special place in my life.</p>
<p><strong>Live &#8211; Throwing Copper</strong><br />
Many people claim that Nirvana&#8217;s album Nevermind was the fall of the hair bands/glam metal that ruled so much of my child hood.  Live&#8217;s album Throwing Copper is what converted me.  I was never a huge fan of Nirvana to begin with (still to this day, not a fan), but the solid rock background and brilliantly raspy lead vocals on this album tugged me into the alternative rock world.  Throwing Copper unleashed Lightning crashes, and not to mention 4 other singles that broke the top 20 of US Alternative Rock charts.  By any and all means and measures, this is a highly regarded album.  It blazed the trail into the world of rock/hard rock/alternative rock for me as I matured past my hair band stages of youth.</p>
<p><strong>Drist &#8211; Bitter Halo</strong><br />
The band Drist is not very well known.  They were discovered by me via Vanbergs/Guitar Hero bonus tracks.  They have since discontinued as a group, but their Bitter Halo album showcases the spirit and aggressiveness of an independent artist trying to make a name for themselves.  The track &#8220;Dissolve&#8221; is one of my favorite songs ever.  Period.  I can&#8217;t really even put the words in place as to why I love this band/album/song &#8211; even though <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/dissolve">I&#8217;ve tried</a>.   I can listen to this entire album anytime, any place and not skip a track.  That&#8217;s hard to beat.</p>
<p><strong>Korn &#8211; Follow the Leader</strong><br />
Korn quite simply defined the nu-metal genre.  Their Follow the Leader album represents the peak and culmination of me as an adult.  This might sound odd, but it&#8217;s quite amazing the bond that a dorm full of college men will develop when they unite as one to repeatedly call into MTV&#8217;s Total Request Live as many times as possible to vote for Korn&#8217;s video: Got the life.  Some days it was number one, some days it lost to the likes of Britney Spears or Backstreet boys.  But the friendships I made during this all impressionable year are still in tact today.  And as &#8220;korney&#8221; as it sounds, this album played a role in that.  Robinson Hall&#8217;s 2nd floor class of 1998-1999 has their unofficial theme song.  And also Reginald Fieldy Arvizu is their bassist.</p>
<p><strong>2pac &#8211; All Eyez on Me</strong><br />
Sure, I went through a gangsta rap phase.   What teenage white small town city boy didn&#8217;t?  I had an expensive car stereo that could really only get a full workout with some serious bumps and bass.  2pac&#8217;s quintessential offering is the single best representation of rap ever created.  It will never be topped, and it has only gotten better as it has aged.  He&#8217;s truly a master with lyrics, and I really &#8220;feel you&#8221; (you feel me??) 2pac.  Countless summer nights spent &#8220;cruising&#8221; with my windows down bumping 2pac over 500 watts and two 12 inch JBL subwoofers will always be the first thing I think of when my sense of hearing starts to get unexplainably worse.</p>
<p><strong>Tool &#8211; Aenima</strong><br />
Tool has an undeniable sound.  They are one of the few bands that you can honestly say &#8220;don&#8217;t sound like anybody else&#8221;.  Their best work (in my opinion) comes from the Aenima album.  Stinkfist, Eulogy, Forty Six and 2, and Aenima are all top tier works that a listener just cannot forget.  Keenan&#8217;s lyrics are very subjective in most cases.  He leaves the listener up to interpret exactly what his point is; and this only adds to the impact of the music as it forces it to become a personal relationship.  Their music is completely pure and almost tribal, and their talent is unmistakable.  The sound of Adam Jones on guitar ices this cake, with his creative palm muting and brutal delivery of seemingly simple power chords.  This album is simply epic.  And it is only fate that they were slated to play in Grand Rapids Michigan on September 11th, 2001.  The show was moved to Sept 13th and it stands alone as one of the most significant events I have ever or will ever attend.</p>
<p><strong>Bullet for My Valentine &#8211; The Poison</strong><br />
The Metalcore genre of music combines the speed and guitar riffs of &#8220;metal&#8221; with a mixture of clean and harsh vocals.  This is a sound that many bands/artists simply cannot pull off without sounding very cheesy (A7X, I look in your direction).  Bullet for My Valentine&#8217;s debut release is one of the best examples of doing this genre justice.  The guitars almost act as an additional singer on this album, as the solos are literally world class.  Their primary musical focus is on guitar riffs; and this is shown not only by the speed and key of their music, but the versatile use of various guitar tunings.  Bullet for My Valentine&#8217;s initial album is very widely regarded as one of the top works in Metalcore, and this is without argument.  The writing is easily relate-able for me, and its easy for me to put myself into the subject matter of these songs.  Even on a first listen, I don&#8217;t think you can help but bob your head and sing along.</p>
<p><strong>Mutiny Within (Self Titled)</strong><br />
Mutiny Within is hard for me to justify on this list.  It&#8217;s a debut album from a new band that hasn&#8217;t had much time to blossom yet.  But even in that scenario, the talent and composition of this album is superior on all counts.  The vocals are nothing short of award winning (wouldn&#8217;t be surprised by a Grammy honestly), and the music plays the perfect counterpart.  The rhythm, lead, bass, and drums are so highly technical that it&#8217;s genuinely unbelievable for all to work together in such a seamless fashion.  They are EASILY the best band in their genre of all time.</p>
<p><strong>Taproot &#8211; Gift</strong><br />
Taproot holds a significant appeal for me on a few different levels.  They put on a fantastic live show which I&#8217;ve seen multiple times.  Mike DeWolf uses very uniquely distorted guitar effects that give off an almost electro-static feel.  Combine that with the far reaching voice of Stephen Richards, and enjoy.   Richards&#8217; clean/harsh mix gives Taproot an unmistakable depth that may turn away some &#8220;hardcore&#8221; fans.  I&#8217;ll admit that I have even felt this way in the past.  But I&#8217;ve grown to appreciate the wider range of music and the slower Taproot most definitely is in that category.  Their album &#8220;Gift&#8221; is by far my favorite offering, even though I&#8217;ve listened to this band for approximately an entire decade.</p>
<p><strong>Disturbed &#8211; Ten Thousand Fists</strong><br />
Disturbed has really achieved a vast following for a &#8220;metal&#8221; band.  They started out as a mockable band with some silly grunting and &#8220;suack&#8221;ing.  But something about their 2nd album transformed them.  Somehow we all went from mocking this band to seamlessly loving them.  The song &#8220;Prayer&#8221; is probably the most clear turning point &#8211; but they continued through their next release.  In my opinion, Ten Thousand Fists is the very apex of the Disturbed bell curve.  They started low, rose to royalty, and have fallen hard unfortunately.  Pain Redefined, Stricken, I&#8217;m Alive, and Sons of Plunder are just a handful of the tracks that define this astounding artistry.  The album rightfully debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200.  Even their recent decent, I can&#8217;t deny the fact that Ten Thousand Fists may genuinely be my favorite album by any band ever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve spent years dealing with Comcast.  I&#8217;ve used them for TV and Internet for the better part of 10 years.  Throughout this time, I&#8217;ve dealt with increasing prices, some fairly despicable customer service, and overall a lack of consumer competence on their part.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had any experience with Comcast to rival the level of <a href="http://vanlandw.com/?s=AT%26T">Vanlandw&#8217;s AT&#038;T travesty</a>, BUT their continuously ass-holish persona accompanied by ever-increasing pricing structure have finally become too much for me to bear.  For example, I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve called for support and ended up with them trying to sell me a triple play bundle with home phone service.  Inherently frustrating, I must admit that I fully enjoyed explaining to the representative that I use Skype with a VoIP USB adapter as my home phone, and it is 32 dollars annually for unlimited calling.</p>
<p>Anyways&#8230; The event to kick off &#8220;operation Comcast BRB&#8221; was my wonderful wife purchasing me a new 50 inch plasma TV.  Such a television commands a respectable television service to accompany it.  As I began looking at Comcast upgrade options, I quickly realized that the digital starter package was way more than I even wanted to consider paying (79 a month to start, 120 after).  The digital premier package with ~200 channels was even more over-priced; with a 119 dollar promo rate for 6 months followed by a $165 dollar fee after that.  Seriously.  165 dollars a month.  This is before adding additional HD tuners or DVR.</p>
<p><strong>The Switch</strong><br />
I knew it was time to make a change, and this had been a long time coming.  First and most importantly, I searched for a new television provider.  I explored Dish Network, Direct TV, and U-verse.  U-verse was most intriguing because I saw them as the likely successor as my internet provider.  But, after pricing out package and options I decided on Dish Network.  It was hard to pass up.  Dish has offered a deal including free HD for life, 15 dollars off for a year, and a wonderful co-worker (chouse) giving me a 50 dollar gift card to dish.  Called, ordered, scheduled.  120 channels with HD and a DVR for literally 32 dollars a month.</p>
<p>Dish obviously doesn&#8217;t offer internet, so that was my next item to tackle.  Options here were fairly limited, and there was never really any other consideration aside from AT&#038;T U-verse.  My Comcast speeds had always been amazing.  I would regularly test at between 20 and 30 megs download speed; so this did make the switch a bit more difficult for me, but Comcast&#8217;s medium level service for Internet starts at 59.99 monthly.  They offered me an option to downgrade to DSL speed and still pay 44.99; but there was no chance of this rancid company staying in my future monthly budget.  I called, ordered, scheduled install of AT&#038;T U-verse 6MB connection for 40 dollars a month.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s review.  I was paying approximately $65 a month for fast internet and for the BASIC television from Comcast (like, 15 channels basic).  Any upgrade strategy through them resulted in 100+ dollars easily.</p>
<p>By making a switch to Dish Network and AT&#038;T U-verse, my bill at this point should be somewhere between 80 and 90 dollars.  So, I spend 15-20 dollars more per month; and I receive a drastically improved television service and broadband internet combination.</p>
<p><strong>The Install</strong><br />
My installation experiences for Dish and U-verse were not smooth by any means.  My dish installer was over 3 hours late past our 4 hour block of appointment time.  By the time he had gotten to my home, I had already contacted Dish to complain; and they had credited my account 25 dollars and rescheduled my installation.  Even with that, I was relieved when the installer arrived.  I was so anxious to get dish going.  The install went quickly and painlessly once he got started, and soon I was watching 120+ channels, messing around with my DVR, and basking in High def victory over my red rival Comcast.  As the dish installer left, 1-800-Comcast ensued with a cancellation.  They tried to sell me home phone service and a triple play as I canceled.  This is where I also found that canceling my 17.99 basic television service resulted in my internet price jumping from 44.99 to 59.99.  Comcast, this is precisely why I hate you &#8211; you raise my price by 14.99 after I get rid of a 17.99 TV service?  You are just horrible people; and at this point I couldn&#8217;t WAIT to get U-verse internet and rid my life of your wretched ways.</p>
<p>My AT&#038;T U-verse installer got to my home at around 9.30 am (he had a 9-11 window).  As he got started, he replaced my wiring from the pole to my home, and began wiring to bring the U-verse internet into my home via the Comcast installed coax (which is awesome on multiple accounts).  But, he soon realized he was getting no signal at the pole as he should be.  He continued, made phone calls, left my house, came back with various people.  In all, 4 people were involved, 3 different AT&#038;T vehicles &#8211; one of which was a Bucket truck, and seemingly a neighborhood re-engineering from AT&#038;T&#8217;s perspective.  Finally, at around 6pm that night, I had mother effing internet.</p>
<p>As soon as my installer left, I again dialed 1-800-Comcast to rid myself completely of this vile and disgusting excuse for a service company.  I desperately tried to record the phone call with Google Voice, but for some reason pressing 4 repeatedly would not engage the call recording.  I tried probably 20 times to initiate recording, and there was never a time in my life that I wanted something more than to record that phone call.  It was monumental.  </p>
<p>The representative tried desperately to sell me on a triple play bundle, to plead with me to not cancel in any way possible.  I told her that I&#8217;ve been down this path countless times, and I don&#8217;t want to pay 120 dollars for two services.  She persisted, talked over top of me, and finally I flat out said &#8220;listen, I appreciate what you&#8217;re trying to do here &#8211; but at this point I have Dish Network installed and I&#8217;m on ATT U-verse internet.  Comcast cables arent even hooked up to my home anymore, and I&#8217;m not going to sign up for any services with this company ever again.&#8221;</p>
<p>This ended the call, and I look forward to my final bill.  I will mail a check with it, with the memo &#8220;ef yoo&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>The Review</strong><br />
Dish&#8217;s TV services are awesome.  I had the 120 channels for maybe 4 days before I upgraded myself to the 200+ package.  This increased my bill by 10 dollars (42 dollars now instead of 32) &#8211; but it was a necessary thing to do.  FX, NFL Network, G4, Discovery Health, and BBC America were some must have channels in the 200 package.</p>
<p>Dish&#8217;s DVR functionality is also awesome.  I wired ethernet to the badboy, and it allows me to remotely access and manage my recordings online, or from my ipod touch (the dish network ipod app rocks).  I enjoyed getting used to DVR functionality, and set up recordings for a variety of shows ranging from Jon Stewart&#8217;s daily show to Top Gear and The &#8220;Steve Wilkos&#8221; show&#8230;  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>One thing that did catch me off guard with Dish, was that the recording on the DVR had to use one of my two TV channels.  So, one of the TV&#8217;s hooked to my primary receiver HAS TO display what is being recorded.  This was by no means a deal breaker for me; but was something that I didn&#8217;t expect to happen.  I did find out that you can watch other recordings while the DVR records shows, so that alleviates some of the frustration there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very happy with Dish, and I fully recommend them as a top notch TV service provider.</p>
<p>AT&#038;T U-verse internet is thus far a solid and consistent connection.  I pay for 6 megs, and my speed tests will regularly show up to 5.8/5.9 megs.  So, I&#8217;m getting what I pay for.  On the other hand, the 2Wire 3600 gateway device that they use leaves a bit to be desired.  I&#8217;m not able to customize the DNS and DHCP settings to any degree (much less turn them off like I want to) &#8211; but I&#8217;m still looking at instituting a work-around for that.  I&#8217;ll figure out something.</p>
<p>The 6 meg speed shows itself from my usual Comcast 20+ speeds.  Downloading an iso or torrent at 500-600k is quite a bit different than my 1-2meg sustainable downloads with Comcast.  Saving 40 bucks a month sure puts that in perspective though&#8230;. and there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m ever going back to Comcast.  I hope that company gets oil spilled on it.  And nobody anywhere around them will even consider offering Lemon scented Dawn to them.</p>
<p>GTFO Comcast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/24-season-8">As I previously posted</a>; I have been very unhappy with this season of 24.  More so than in any other previous season, and with greater and greater intensity.</p>
<p>I had decided about 5 episodes in that I was giving myself half of the season; and if 24 did not improve or show signs of turn-around, then I was going to cease watching it forever. (as Vanlandw has stated; I have said this before &#8211; sometimes it&#8217;s been an idle threat.  But, I did not and will not ever finish watching Season 6).  Well, episode 12 came and went; and all I got was more and more angry at how ridiculous the show has become.   So, while episode 13 was airing last week, I played my new Nintendo Wii.   While episode 14 was airing yesterday, I was watching &#8220;Religulous&#8221;.  Let me tell you, it feels SO good to disconnect from this show.  I have jumped ship and I will never ever make any effort to swim back.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but feel a little bit of sadness here, but the more I think about it &#8211;  the more my sadness becomes anger.  24 was a truly ground-breaking series and was undeniably top notch television in it&#8217;s prime.  There are few other television programs that can rival 24 in it&#8217;s golden years &#8211; but the simple fact is that Fox just utterly destroyed this program.  It changed from a gritty drama to a laughable ratings-whore composed of LITERALLY trash.  Well, Fox, the public noticed&#8230;  You managed to alienate and infuriate the most loyal fan-base of all time;  Even they can only keep their hopes and dreams up for so long, and Season 8 has proven to be the last straw.  The ratings have dropped, the quality has continued it&#8217;s downward tailspin, meanwhile the only thing that has gone up has been the show&#8217;s production budget.   Finally; arguably 3 years too late, Fox has decided to put 24 out of it&#8217;s misery and cancel it.</p>
<p>So, what went wrong?  What happend?  Why did 24 limp into mediocrity?  Let&#8217;s run a comparative; Looking at a semi-similar series: &#8220;The Shield&#8221;  on FX.</p>
<p>The Shield is also a gritty drama.  The Shield has a similar &#8220;bad ass&#8221; main character &#8211; Vic Mackey.  And, it has similar struggles of that main character as their job and life effect their friendships and families.  Yes, the settings and plots are sometimes very different &#8211; but 24 could have learned alot from how The Shield bowed out.  The most important thing:  The writers of The Shield never changed the heart of their show.  They never changed plots to try and cater to the masses.  In fact, they gave us scenes that we didn&#8217;t even want to see (Lem).  They gave us a final two seasons that were literally gut-wrenching, made me feel sick to watch at times, and genuinely brought me to tears.  It was utter downfall&#8230;</p>
<p>But, it was a most epic and decisive series finale as can possibly be had.</p>
<p>24, your death is brought not by skilled and emotional content like The Shield; but rather by your own greed and lust for your success.  The higher your ratings went, the further and more over the top you felt you needed to push the show.  It didn&#8217;t take long for you to push too far, to the point where it became a cheesy satire of it&#8217;s former self.  You searched for meaning in more/larger explosions, exploitations of your main character, and trying to find the charm you once had.  You killed off the characters that everyone liked while keeping around all the characters that everyone hates.  You bring in new characters to fill in the same old roles.   You put a mask on recycled plot lines hoping nobody will notice, while you combine them and cram more of them in each season.  Well, you did it &#8211; and you failed.</p>
<p>You straight up blew it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re on your death bed and I&#8217;m not coming to visit you.  I don&#8217;t want to see you this way, and I have no desire to see how you meet your end.  I don&#8217;t owe you ANYTHING.  You un-deniably suck.  You managed to turn away your best friends at the most critical part of your life, and as far as I&#8217;m concerned you can fall into oblivion alone; reaping exactly what you have sown.</p>
<p>Good riddance; gtfo</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Backstory&#8230;</strong><br />
As an attempt at motivation, my wife wagered that if I could lose half of the amount of weight that she gains during pregnancy; then I can pick out and purchase a television of my choosing.  So, that started me down the path of getting unbelievably motivated to lose some weight, and eat healthier&#8230; </p>
<p>I started a basic calorie cut in February.  I ate grain cereals, more fruits/veggies, and overall just cut down on portions.  I stopped drinking soda comletely, I started drinking water, and I went from 254.2 pounds down to 242.2 in roughly 1 month.  But, my completely sedentary lifestyle seemed to only want to let go of 12 pounds of it&#8217;s &#8220;backup&#8221; &#8211; so it was time to find some exercise to keep this going.</p>
<p>The problem with that is: I hate exercise.  Plain and simple.  I hate running, walking, biking, jogging, etc etc etc etc.  Really it boils down to the fact that I enjoy physically moving as little as possible. </p>
<p>With my stubborn and compulsive nature, the P90X program did seem like a perfect fit.  I have a coworker who shed 40 pounds with the program, and one of my cousins has seen results very early on as well.  I read some reviews and researched online a pretty fair amount; and it all seemed to only confirm that P90X really does work&#8230;  There&#8217;s no BS to it, it&#8217;s just freaking hard core working out to get results.  And the thing is, I could actually see myself pushing through a hard 90 days to get those fast results.  In fact, I&#8217;d much rather do that than to go running 3 times a week.  I literally hate running so much that I&#8217;d rather do 6 hours plus of working out than to go running one time.</p>
<p><strong>The Beginning&#8230;</strong><br />
A good friend loaned me their copy of P90X so I could try it out.  It gives you a full diet plan, a lot of information, and a set of DVDs containing the workouts.  I used the information to do a little prep-work, create a spreadsheet to track my progress, plan my eating habits, and get some groceries.</p>
<p>With the pre-flight check taken care of, I started P90X on 3/14/2010.</p>
<p>I am so out of shape it is really pretty sad.  During my first workout, my body responded with creaking, popping, and snapping sounds as I used muscles that rarely even think about flexing.  I had to make sure to start slow, pace myself, and ease into P90X because it really is an intense workout.  It&#8217;s designed to take already fit people that last mile and really change their bodies.  So, I have to modify the techniques on many exercises (girl pushups, lower weights, fewer reps) in order to even do them.  But, I am doing them&#8230;</p>
<p>I honestly haven&#8217;t done any exercise like this in probably 10 years.  I went through phases of biking, treadmilling, and even trying jump rope &#8211; but those were all short lived phases that did little more than elevate my heart rate temporarily and make me angry.</p>
<p>Now 3 days into P90X, my entire body is stiff and sore &#8211; so I&#8217;m positive that it&#8217;s working.  I&#8217;ve made it into a routine to start my day waking up at 5 am, pound out the P90X workout (1-1.5 hours), and then eat an egg-white omelet with fruit and whole grain toast for breakfast.  Oddly enough it has been a very simple routine for me to adopt.</p>
<p><strong>The Story Thus Far</strong><br />
As I&#8217;m sure my good friend will want their own set back, I&#8217;m definitely going to order my own set of P90X and make sure to stick to this program.  With the amount of work it is, I just can&#8217;t imagine it not making significant change to my person very quickly.</p>
<p>Even being only 3 days in, I can feel the changes.  I can tell my metabolism is jump started working out in the morning, so I use that and capitalize on it by eating better.  I also haven&#8217;t drank any coffee since starting because I feel more energetic throughout the day.  My weight hasn&#8217;t gone down at all yet; but it has stayed exactly the same vs a daily up/down fluctuation that I was dealing with.  I think that is a good sign that I&#8217;m eating steadily vs the feast or famine mentality.</p>
<p>I fully expect that this first week is all about my body adjusting to this new and heavy workload&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m definitely keeping it up, tracking my progress, and looking forward to seeing some results.</p>
<p>BRING IT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[SPOILERS FROM VARIOUS SEASONS INCLUDING SEASON 8.   IF YOU&#8217;VE NOT SEEN EVERY EPISODE OF 24 THEN READ AT YOUR OWN RISK]</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8230;   &#8230;<br />
</strong></p>
<p>24 has been a staple of my adult life.</p>
<p>From watching season 1 on DVD in pretty much a single sitting, to various fights and &#8220;plant activites&#8221; with Vanlandw, the awe-inspiring fate of Nina Meyers, and Edgar&#8217;s famous &#8220;CHLOE?!&#8230; AAARHRH&#8221; scene &#8211; The list of memories goes on and on.</p>
<p>But, for as much amazing and compelling drama as this show has produced; it has produced at least the equal amount of complete BS and sheer annoyance.  This trend seems to be correlated with each new season that has been released; with the exception of perhaps season 5.  With seasons 1 and 2 being near perfection; I think it&#8217;s almost a shame what this show has now become.  So begins my hatred and critique of Season 8.</p>
<p>I somehow managed to watch all of season 7.  I SOMEHOW looked past zombie-Tony.  I somehow looked past the over-use of &#8220;<em>Oh&#8230; Are you going to torture him Jack</em>?&#8221;.  I somehow looked past the constantly changing good/bad/good/bad Tony.  And, finally, I would say I was able to look past the annoying women characters.  Read: President Taylor; Renae; Chloe; President Taylor&#8217;s bitch daughter.  Really, the show is physically incapable of producing a female character that I do not hate with fiery brimstone furiousness.</p>
<p>I was going to try to reserve judgment on this season to let it get at least half way through &#8211; but it&#8217;s just not possible.  The list of complete BS that I feel the need to call out has grown past the tipping point and the spillage shall begin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chloe:  Why this show continues to kill off interesting and relatable characters whilst keeping this permanent annoyance is just beyond me.  I guess it may help female viewers relate to the show, but she adds merely a layer of stupid woman for all the action and real drama to fight through.  I hate Chloe.  In fact, I hate Chloe so much that I have vetoed it as a possible baby name even though it is my wife&#8217;s favorite.</li>
<li>Dana Walsh:  Apparently the top counter terrorism agency in the country just fails year after year to do standard background checking procedures.  I&#8217;m so sick of the mole/badguy/general shady person plot line in 24.  Dana Walsh apparently has some sort of questionable past that she&#8217;s running from.  So, she&#8217;s apparently used her amazing level of intelligence to create a new identity and get a new job with CTU.  Her hair is always waved over one shoulder.  And, her face just really bothers me.  Her existence enrages me even further since she&#8217;s the fiancée of Cole &#8220;Freddy Prinze Jr.&#8221; Ortiz.</li>
<li>Cole &#8220;Freddy Prinze Jr.&#8221; Ortiz: He is played by Freddy Prinze Junior.</li>
<li>Renae Walker:  Imagine this line being spoken in a Swedish Chef type of voice; Cus that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m saying it.  &#8220;Ooooh I&#8217;m Renae Walker and I&#8217;ve had such a tough couple years that now I&#8217;m a female Jack Bauer.&#8221;  Poor Renae.  She had it rough and now she&#8217;s an outcast who gets by and gets things done via her renegade attitude.  24 Doesn&#8217;t need a female Jack Bauer.  She shouldn&#8217;t be on this show in this season.  OH&#8230;. MAN&#8230; THERE IS A RUSSIAN CRIME SYNDICATE INVOLVED AND APPARENTLY THIS FORMER FBI AGENT JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE BEST RUSSIAN UNDER-COVER OPERATIVE ON THE ENTIRE PLANET!&gt;!&gt;!!&gt;!11..1.&gt;.    bs.</li>
<li>CTU Itself:  Chloe.  Mole/badguy.  Blue-tool headsets.  &#8220;We have our suspect, this is the only possible scenario &#8211; even though strong evidence points otherwise&#8221;.  Dumb.</li>
<li>The Plot:  The assassination plot has been done before.  The nuclear threat has been done before.  Apparently now they are mixed into the same season.  Jack can&#8217;t say the work nuclear correctly.  I hate when people say nuke-u-lar.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far I am really not impressed with 24, and I&#8217;m really doubting I&#8217;ll be able to watch it through the rest of this season 8.  CTU feels like a high-school in the valley.  Not a high tech counter-terrorism organization.  This is a pretty big fail.  I don&#8217;t like any of the new characters.  I don&#8217;t like the ones they&#8217;re choosing to bring back.  So far I don&#8217;t like the plot.  The only thing I&#8217;ve enjoyed this season thus far has been Jack&#8217;s kill by way of axe to the chest (Vanlandw where is bauercount seriously!).</p>
<p>In my opinion this show has long since run it&#8217;s course&#8230;  There have been quick glimpses of good television at points over a couple of the most recent seasons &#8211; but overall they have become fewer and farther between each other.  I&#8217;m growing tired of 24, and that is a very difficult thing to pen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend has turned into a massive achievement fest for Vanbergs and myself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not exactly sure when it happened; but at some point within the last 6-8 months I have become completely OCD about my gamerscore and rep on Xbox Live.  I don&#8217;t spend countless hours getting every achievement in every game that I own; but I spend plenty of extra time hunting down worthwhile achievements trying to boost up my score as much as possible.  I&#8217;ve desperately plunged into the multiplayer arenas of Halo 3 and Modern Warfare 2 in search of 5 star rep.  I&#8217;ve begged and pleaded my friends and foes to &#8220;prefer me&#8221;.  The list of XboxLive addiction shame just goes on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not enough of an achievement whore to use cheats/godmodes/glitching to blast an easy 1000 points out of my games.  I do maintain a certain level of purism &#8211; but, at the same time, I am definitely enough of an achievement whore to seek out and destroy games that give an easy 1000 g. Oddly enough I blame Vanlandw at least partially for starting this:  Back on my birthday he purchased me &#8220;Avatar &#8211; The last Airbender&#8221; for my birthday (not to be confused in any way with James Cameron&#8217;s Avatar film); this is easily the simplest/easiest achievement booster game known to man.  <a title="Avatar - 1000 points in 59 seconds.  Youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kszPXq0Vho0">You literally get 1000 gamerscore in less than 2 minutes</a>. (youtube vid)</p>
<p>Fast forward to this weekend.  I notice on my XboxLive account that Vanbergs has magically come within just a few points of my 9,000 point gamerscore.   Somehow he magically discovered through a coworker that the entire slew of the &#8220;2k6&#8221; sports game franchise offer ridiculously easy achievements.    These NBA/NHL/NCAA/MLB 2k6 games I think must have been developed so early in the pre-launch days of the Xbox360 that they just didn&#8217;t quite understand how the achievement system was supposed to work.   Instead of having 40-50 achievements that add up to the 1,000 points, they offer FIVE&#8230; this results in each achievement being worth hundreds of points compared to 5, 10, 20 points in &#8220;normal&#8221; Xbox games.</p>
<p>The achievements are for things like:</p>
<ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>Score 50 points with a player</li>
<li>Make 15 three pointers with any team</li>
<li>Get 6 blocks with any player</li>
<li>Score a goal with a defenseman</li>
</ul>
<p>Vanbergs and I teamed up each scouring various Game Stop locations for these used games and were able to come up with a pretty darn complete collection of easy 1,000 point games.  In addition to the 2k6 series, we got Fight Night round 3, Madden 2006, NBA Live 2006, Prey, and King Kong.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve done done the 2k6 sports games only, and am working my way up to the others.  The games are just ridiculously easy.  Playing allstar teams against the worst teams in the league results in an easy 1,000 points in a single exhibition game.  Sliders can be adjusted to basically make the opponent team play like 4th grade girls; even if the difficulty is set to super star level.  Playing Duke vs. Princeton in NCAA 2k6, I seriously won 238 &#8211; 0.  The Princeton team did not score one basket.</p>
<p>Now &#8211; there are a couple achievements in here that I did have to work fairly hard at.  It&#8217;s no small feat to get 20 rebounds with a single player, especially when the team doesnt hardly shoot the ball.  Or, to get 6 blocks with a single player.  Or, to score a goal while you have 2 players in a penalty box.  But I was able to find tactics that covered each achievement and do it in one single game.  I would just shoot half-courters to get my own rebounds, intentionally hack/slash the other team to get penalty box time, and jump around like a mad man at hopes of blocking shots.  etc etc etc.</p>
<p>I must admit that I do feel a little bit cheap after this weekend&#8217;s activities thus far &#8211; but I take solace in the fact that I am not cheating whatsoever.  I haven&#8217;t entered cheat codes.  I haven&#8217;t entered any god mode codes.  I haven&#8217;t glitched any games, even though there are published glitches on a few games I own that COULD result in easy 1,000 points.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m simply reasearching and finding games that have easy, high yield achievements &#8211; and I&#8217;m playing them legitimately.  In fact, it was a pretty frickin&#8217; impressive amount of work to find and procure all of these games!  It was pretty satisfying though.  I paid $2-$5 per game getting them used.</p>
<p>Could I make more of a sport out of this by playing the games at my actual skill level and not making it painfully easy?  Sure.  Does it take some of the pride and prestige away from blasting past 10,000 points for my gamerscore?  Yes it does, to be quite honest.  Would I do it exactly this same way if I had it to do over again?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I had first played through Grand Theft Auto 4, I did not take any steps to save my money.  I spent freely on clothes, food, weapons, and ammo&#8230;</p>
<p>This REALLY ended up frustrating me because as I defeated the game, I came very far from having enough money to satisfy the &#8220;Half Million&#8221; achievement.  To get this 55g achievement, the player needs to gain a balance of 500,000 dollars in the game.  And, if you can&#8217;t do it with the end-game bonus then your options become very limited.  Many users have guides on youtube for getting it by using cheats; mainly by spawning expensive cars and selling them.  But, that&#8217;s very time consuming and many purists don&#8217;t like to use cheats to get something like that.</p>
<p>I had given in and decided that this achievement was not possible short of a complete re-play of the game from scratch.  That was not going to happen.  Mentally I tried to forget this achievement existed but very unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>Enter GTA4: The Ballad of Gay Tony.</p>
<p>I was very surprised and extremely overjoyed to find out that the Ballad of Gay Tony expansion still allowed you to unlock achievements for the original GTA4 release.  When I found out, I went on an achievement unlocking spree of sorts:  Flew my helicopter under all the bridges, went on all the helicopter tours, blew up 10 cars in 10 seconds, survived 6 star wanted level for 5 minutes, took a long taxi ride without skipping, etc etc etc.</p>
<p>Then I had what I considered to be a very smart idea:  I thought of a way to very simply get the Half million achievement.  TBoGT has a cage-fighting minigame where you can fight against people or bet on fights for money.  This location is painfully close to your safe house/save point.  I figured there would be some sort of maximum for the amount you could place on a bet in this fight minigame &#8211; but there is no limit!</p>
<p>Being an expansion, TBoGT left me with somewhere around 40,000 dollars total.  Quite a ways from the half-mil mark.  But, I went to work on a fool proof venture.  I saved my game immediately before visiting the cage fight arena and betting all of my money on one fight.  The first fight I did choose correctly; so I had a cool 80k.  I take the one block drive to re-save my game and then proceed to do the exact same thing and bet every penny I have on one fight.  This 2nd fight I chose wrong 3 different times <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />   But, through the magic of saved games I very quickly had 160,000 dollars.</p>
<p>I think you get the idea.  I repeated the above steps until I got bored; which left me just under 2 million dollars&#8230;  And, along the way I got the famed &#8220;Ka-bloop&#8221; sound and the 55g achievement &#8220;Half million&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve totally been on self fulfilling achievement quests as a whole lately trying to get my numbers up somewhere near Vanlandw&#8217;s 10k gamerscore.  I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m catching him to any degree as he has progressed at an astounding rate; but my Gamerscore has surprassed 6,000 as of last night.  That is pretty impressive in my opinion &#8211; considering my Gamerscore was 1,000 back in June of this year.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;ve really gotten my money&#8217;s worth out of my 360 this year.  The turning point was when I decided to move it upstairs vs being down in our Basement.  I simply just did not go downstairs ever and barely ever played my 360.  A very sad story.  But I&#8217;m making up for it now and trying to cram as much video games into my soul as humanly possible before April of 2010 comes around.  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Hooray for daytime video game posts.</p>
