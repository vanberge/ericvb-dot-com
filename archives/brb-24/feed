					<description><![CDATA[lmao rusty i don&#039;t really like women at all either.  With the show three years down the line the last thing I want to see is Chloe with a child, and i&#039;m sure to be a power hungry woman in power president.  I hate Hillary I&#039;m going to hate &quot;Cherry&quot;.

I don&#039;t like the three years down the line Jack is getting to old storyline wise.  I like no CTU but i&#039;m sure FBI or secret service is goin to take up the incompetent CTU parts of the storyline.  DC will be cool a new color pallet on screen should be cool. 

So far news for season 7 is 50/50 when i was hoping for 75/25 good bad.  Oh well there is still time.]]></description>

becomes
season 7 of 24 of “orphan popularity show”

Vanbergs, you have already stated that you are not going to watch orphan popularity show next season... you can&#039;t go back on your van-word just because of &#039;no ctu&#039;.  with a woman president, chloe bitch, etc, they may just as well have ctu.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Google Translated... wow this came out well:
--------------------------------------------
&lt;p&gt;Speech today to of “cherry Jones”. This model perhaps, the woman whom center ages slowly you see very normally, but -, she being minimum, is not normal. For the present there is she from the normal state to which her existence changes the world permanently. She was possible and made what so complete to form the text of ascii where I am at last imitated in order to describe profound happenings. As for this woman…The television program “24 &quot; my viewing and fanship were finished officially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officially. It is finished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I when I purchase the first season of DVD, am directly 24 fans ever since the university. I looked at one that it sits down almost and was grasped completely by show. I at the time of all, the series, looked at the whole of season 6 from season 1; But I with season 7 of 24 of “orphan popularity show” look at that it continues not to be, expressing and expressing, in addition furthermore try. Since starting, the orphan this holiness which is, the power which makes the drama of the television which is extolled ruinous had done that everything. As for the always ridiculous plotting line thin alignment upwardness you are brought up, - make interest cause, deep quality is banished the dying from the show which goes away from the principal focus to the female dog of extravagant asshole depending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fatigue the season when it cuts 6 permanently me… The same method approximately 24 as for me I never - never - me who am not felt making season and 1,2,3 when, making five equal without being possible it was affirmative. “24” very made the very serious line cross, there was no thing which then comes returning. I cannot come accompanying by my in order to enter into detail, but season 6 of 24 was fair dogshit. I hated that. I that why maintained viewing, because 80% my raw child of the hole of the douche is the son of the jack completely, because you thought that I would like to win the money from vanlandw, it was. And, I to be close to dangerous extent in exile of show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cherry Jones” lady participate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of your those which you do not know, cherry Jones has done the fact that it is American president of the following season of 24. I hear this rumor, as for VANBERGS he considerably secure that being there was an formality which informs about me. (Sees here) he was correct. As for me rather why”, but it can put my finger in the `and the fact that makes unprocessed rage and self-indulgent hatred the camel launch, pulverizes the camel in the film of the zombie of Rob - 24 is inserting the president of the woman in combination. Most accurate descriptions which are did not break “the camel”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, Vanberge never does not look at 24 for the second time&lt;/p&gt;
