					<description><![CDATA[Vanlandw - 300 is not a franchise and I hope you are raped by swarthy Greek men for suggesting it.

Vanberge - BET has gotten worse over the years.  BET in the early 90&#039;s was what MTV has become now.  Imagine another 15 years of devolving at the hands of Black people.

Vanberge &#038; Vanlandw - After the last season of Lost, I don&#039;t think it could be considered good.  Sure, it started strong and ended very strong, but the whole middle was just kinda blah.  But still better than just about everything else.

Vanbergs - Even the good movies are rehashes of better movies lately. 1408?  Meet Cube.   Sunshine?  A much better version of The Core.  300?  I&#039;m sad to say was a minimal rip-off of the old Spartacus/Ben-Hur style, although much better done.

The only things on TV I watch anymore are Foster&#039;s Home for Imaginary Friends, Adult Swim, and the occasional CSI: Clone.  Although, I saw a commercial for Kill Point and I must say, it looked fairly badass.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s just that production companies aren&#039;t taking chances any more.  If you look at everything that comes out, it&#039;s a REHASH of something that was brave enough to have taken a chance.  Case in point:  Japanese style horror movies after &quot;The Ring&quot;.  Think of all the clones that followed that shit.  Same with the Saw franchise.  All the &quot;torture horror&quot; movies that are seeing the light of day.  It&#039;s because one film will take a chance, make a shit ton of money, and then the copycats come in and ride the coat tails until the idea is milked dry.  

1408 was fucking awesome, Sunshine was fucking awesome, and 300 was fucking awesome.  Those movies were pretty innovative in my opinion.  1408 took place almost entirely in a single hotel room.  It was badass.  Sunshine was just totally unlike anything I&#039;ve ever seen.  300 speaks for its goddamn self.

I&#039;m not even getting started with television.  The Wire, The Shield...those are the two best shows on tv.  That&#039;s it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Family Guy is shit, there&#039;s no way that could be considered good TV.

The only shows on TV I make sure I watch are:
-24 (although I may not next year)
-The Shield (only has one more season)
-The Office
-Pysch

I thought The Simpsons movie was good though.  It wasn&#039;t great, but compared to how bad the TV show has been lately, I thought it was really good.  I haven&#039;t been to the movies much this year, so I&#039;ve pretty much missed everything good :-(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Vanlandw - I forgot to list &quot;Lost&quot; - good call... I also forgot to add the Sopranos.  But, maybe that doesn&#039;t count because it&#039;s run it&#039;s course...

As for family guy, i haven&#039;t watched it in months.  Fox airs 1 or 2 new episodes of it, then takes a 4 week break.  I&#039;ve lost interest in that show to the point that i don&#039;t even know what season of family guy they are on now.  5?  6?  So, i no longer list it as good, but - it is not bad either.

Devin brown, there is no way i could watch 3 straight hours of BET.  There&#039;s no way i could even make an effort to try that.  BET is just like MTV i&#039;m sure.]]></description>
