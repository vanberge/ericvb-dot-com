					<description><![CDATA[I hear you on that vanlandw...  I bought a 40 dollar home hair cutting kit, the clippers seem really nice.  They plowed right through my hair.

40 bucks is exactly 2 haircuts for me.  So these clippers will literally pay for themselves in 2 months.  That saves me 240 dollars a year.  These clippers have a 5 year warranty.

I am forever an advocate for &#039;the buzzcut&#039; and all its variations.  The butch.  The &#039;high and tight&#039;.  Even a fully clean shave.

You should bic your head vanlandw.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[the other thing good about buzzing your hair is the money you have on haircuts.  In the past year I&#039;ve paid for a haircut twice.  Once when you got married...and once when payner got married.  That is $30 dollars in a year in hair maintenance.  I bet women pay that in week.

lol?]]></description>
