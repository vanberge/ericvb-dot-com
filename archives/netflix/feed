					<description><![CDATA[Casino Royale sucked, 1 star.

I have recently reactivated my account in order to view the entire Star Trek series. I don&#039;t even like Star Trek, but someone pointed out that they are a bunch of commie mother fuckers. So I am reviewing it in that context.

Anyhow. In my experience, you get the best performance if you queue contains less than 10 titles.]]></description>

If waiting 30 days before i can access new releases is the one con to netflix, i&#039;m still plenty fine with that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[basically netflix is good for long tail (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail) items. if you&#039;re a &quot;new release&quot; person, after a few months you will become incredibly frustrated with companies like netflix. if you read chris anderson&#039;s book, the most interesting part is how the long tail can actually shape and change cultural interests by making esoteric content easier to receive. you may think you want the latest lord of the rings dvd, but what you REALLY want is the Director&#039;s Cut of Commando, which only really looks appealing to you and 3 other people. :)]]></description>

Deja Vu - excellent
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - Didn&#039;t see
Blood Diamond - Didn&#039;t see
The Break-Up - Eh.  Not enough shiny moments to make up for the bad
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl - Excellent
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man‚Äôs Chest - Not as Good, still good
A Scanner Darkly - I loved it.  Not for everyone though.
World Trade Center - Didn&#039;t see
The Salton Sea - Didn&#039;t see
16 Blocks - Excellent]]></description>

You should obviously become a netflix member to view your friends ratings.  :-P]]></description>
