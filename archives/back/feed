					<description><![CDATA[gg, and agreed with hw, try being the expert in building association, then you have to fix problems for the past people that lived there, as well as the other assholes who make too much money and are to lazy and stupid to do it themselves, and going to the local hardware store where the dude only speaks polish is annoying too, enjoy the castle king vanberge!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Enjoy the new house honeymoon - it doesn&#039;t last long.  Since I got my house, I&#039;ve become an &quot;expert&quot; plumber, electrician, plasterer, and painter as well as learning all about wood floors, asbestos, gas lines.  You&#039;ll probably figure out soon enough that the people who owned your house before you were either idiots, lazy or both and undoing someone else&#039;s mistakes take three times as long as doing it in the first place.  BTW, whatever you&#039;ve spent at HD is nothing compared to what you will spend.  Enjoy!  brb.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome Back to P4P and vanberge4! Thanks for the kudos, but not needed... 

The entering of a new phase in this manure spreader they call &#039;life&#039; has been the instigator of the change you feelings regarding maturity... the extra responsibility imposed with decisions made that force the trend you noticed IS what matures a person... That, or you end up in proverbial pile that results when you unload that manure spreader while standing behind it. 

I have no doubt that the mcmanus brothers will be the drivers of the tractor pulling said &#039;nure spreader, contolling their own destiny, rather than responding to the crap flung as a result of someone else.

That alone is reason for pride in them... ;  )]]></description>
