					<description><![CDATA[1st- vanlandw: &#039;vanbergm&#039; is catastrophic??? I think not! so sayeth King Van!

2nd- The &#039;shitway&#039; was evolution unto itself. As technology and game graphics started the logarithmic spiral up, this dog-turd box of electronic doo-doo literally inspired King Van and the Prince Vans to re-design the computer as we know it, hence spurring the onset of the techno vanberge we now know and love.
3rd- while parents may be able to shape and form the product of their union, without a solid base to work with, it amounts to little. As both sons of Van have made us immeasurably proud, it appears that we had some damn good stock to work with... 8  )
4th- Friendships formed for vanberge and vanbergs were not only theirs... but also additions to our family circle, too. Their friends are our friends, and while uncommon amongst parents nowadays, we gladly open our hearts and home to the Friends of Van... the choices of friends made shows considerable wisdom by our off-spring!

Lastly- No parents could be more proud of the choices made by the Sons of Van, and they are BOTH admired and loved immensely, as is Queen Van the 2nd... admirable choices worthy of all the praise and acknowledgement King Van has.

					<description><![CDATA[Dear vanberge,

I am very glad vanbergs was not born a woman either.  Who knows what his GVSU email name would have been.  That is a good question for KathyVB what she would have named &quot;vanbergs&quot; if vanbergs was a woman.  My bet a female vanbergs would be named Maude so he would have been &quot;vanbergm&quot;...and that would be catastrophic. 

A very good post from numba four I&#039;m]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love you and am very glad you were not born a female vanbege :-[  Who knows how different I would be if mickeyvb wasn&#039;t genetically predisposed to produce male offspring.

As for &quot;whitey&quot;, he really is one of the top five most villainous characters in video game history.  Seriously, I think it&#039;s ranked like this:
#5.  Bowser
#4.  Vile Red Falcon
#3.  Vergil (DMC)
#2.  Whitey
#1.  Liquid Snake

Shake and Bake indeed.]]></description>
