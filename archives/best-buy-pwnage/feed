					<description><![CDATA[JJA:
I don&#039;t think I am making it out better than it seems.  Clearly the number of forum hits on CAG&#039;s site speaks volumes.

Granted there aren&#039;t any &quot;top tier&quot; titles like Gears of War 2, Grand Theft Auto, Bio Shock, etc ...  But there are plenty of playable games.  And to get brand new games for 10 bucks is all but unheard of.

My quantum of solace game was pricemarked 40 bucks, the Bourne game was priced 59.99 - so those are pretty dang good deals.  DMC4 and SoulCaliber4 were I think 19.99 and 29.99 respectively.



VANLANDW:
You&#039;re welcome vanlandw I was glad to get Too Human for you.  And you&#039;re absolutely right.  Seeing the Bourne game ring up as 9.99 for 50 dollars off just filled me with Joy.  Even if the game sucks, I will relish in that fact.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I picked up DMC4 used though gamefly about nine months ago for $10 dollars. 

The way I look at it is that there isn&#039;t many chances to get games for $10 bucks. Most new games are $60 dollars and even getting 2-3 hours out of a $10 dollar game is worth it. Keep in mind going to the movies is almost that price these days. 

I love CAG&#039;n. Mostly I do spend way too much on video games but I like it, it&#039;s a hobby and I could spend a lot more money on something worse.

There is a certain charm to going into a store, seeing a game is marked for $60 dollars, and walking out with it for $10 bucks.

GG on your finds vanberge and thanks again for grabin Too Human for me yesterday. I went to BB today before work and was unable to find a copy of it so you saved my ass. Today I picked up the Bourne game and it should be a decent looking romp for easy achievements.
