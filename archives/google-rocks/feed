Creating a new desktop OS at this point would be virtually impossible due to the economies of scale vested in Windows.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i agree with both of you.  I like some of their services but I just can&#039;t think they are going to be perfect angels forever

http://www.vanlandw.com/blosxom.cgi/2005/03/01#03012005

i posted on something i totally disliked a while ago.....

Also, gmail could use a functionally update IMO and the google reader is just not as good as something like Gregarius or bloglines

but for most users and for free you really can&#039;t beat some of their services...

for quick searches google is without question the best]]></description>
