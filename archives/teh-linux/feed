					<description><![CDATA[Interesting vanberge.  As much as I don&#039;t really like linux I&#039;m glad you are doing this.  Switching to OSX was a nice change of pace for me but I still haven&#039;t fully made a switch to anything.  My &quot;server&quot; still has 2003 and my laptop still has XP and my work machine is XP.  After you and fulljeff using and liking that ubuntu stuff I may throw that on my laptop just to give it a shot.

Do you think I&#039;l run into any issues having a Nvidia card in my laptop.  I remember a few years ago running linux and having such problems with video drivers.  That GLX looks interesting as well....]]></description>
