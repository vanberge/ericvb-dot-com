					<description><![CDATA[Joe,
I&#039;m pretty much the same as you.  Even thought I hate it more than I like it, I can&#039;t seem to live without it.  It&#039;s an addiction I think.

I always come back for more, and have been every year since this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey bro... I am curious if you have given up fantasy since you posted this... I have been playing with the same group of guys for over a decade.. every year I tell myself &quot; That&#039;s it.. I gotta stop playing.. &quot; I get so bummed out every year because I am so stressed out every Sunday.. I miss just watching football and not rooting for players and hoping other players suck. I just cant remember watching football before fantasy.. Anyway.. I always say I am going to quit, and then the next year I forget how that feeling felt and I rejoin... then I regret it by week two.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;looking forward to Ricky Williams rushing for 870 yards tonight, scoring 45 touchdowns, and throwing a TD pass to himself for 99 yards. 3 hrs ago&quot;

Yeah I started drooling from laughing after reading that. 

I don&#039;t think Ricky Williams is going to score 200 points tonight but I guess you never know lol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fantasy Football is just a rollercoster of emotions. Please don&#039;t quit vanberge you kept me playing after I was 0-4 and I lost a few close ones there too. I would just suggest taking a few weeks off. Just set your line up before the weekend and forget about it. If you quit our entire leauge is done forever. I also wouldn&#039;t say the talent on my team is bad just nobody really picked it up. I put up  a few decent weeks during my losing streak and I only lost by one point in week 1. I&#039;ve also made some good moves as well by getting Orton this week. 

I was only on stat tracker yesterday becuase I was playing against you. Next week I&#039;m just going to set my lineup and hopefully not even check till monday. If you have made and finalized your decision to 100% brb fantasy football I will understand but for the sake of our leauge I will be sad to see you go :&#039;(

I&#039;ll trade you Brees for Turner. lol?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You bring up a good point fulljeff - but I actually think I&#039;ve played to those trends very well and being pretty consistent.

For example, I was able to capitalize on those types of fluke performances from Saints RB Mike Bell and also from Eagles RB Lesean McCoy.

It just really really REALLY sucks that I am 1 - 4 and other people are 4 - 1 when they have scored less points than my team.   I may need to see an anger management counsellor regarding this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As dramatic as you make it sound, those are actually pretty close games. For example, in week two I won 235-79, and then lost the following week 68-139 with the same godamn players.

This year has been really tough because of the wild swings across the board. Very few players are playing consistently week to week. I&#039;ve been playing for years, and I haven&#039;t seen anything like it.

I think part of the reason is that teams are doing a much better job managing the depth of their teams. So, if a player isn&#039;t doing fantastic out of the gates, they basically get replaced by someone else almost as good. Its a system that really allows for break out performances that are completely unpredictable.
If you look at it on the bright side, the Lions won a game this year. ;-)]]></description>
