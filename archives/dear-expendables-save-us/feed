					<description><![CDATA[The hard action genre has been totally stagnant for years. Anything with a budget has been dumped in the pg-13 range for anything adaptation (popular books, comic books). The public has accepted bad action (shaky cam, editing with no flow or story,brief CG, 3D) and the ratings don&#039;t help anything at all. Either you are pg-13 and everybody can see it or your R and sabotage your audience. Everything is made for a mass audience now. 

Watch Gladiator then watch Robin Hood. Ridley Scott. The action in Robin Hood was abysmal. 

NOTHING is made for the 30 year old male that wants intelligent well crafted action movies. 

I would love for holy wood to make a hard &#039;R&#039; movie with a strong adult themes and well crafted gun battles. Not over the top guns but realistic guns &quot;Heat&quot; style.

Nobody is doing shootouts I would pay anything for a good movie with a good shootout. 

Mass Effect 2 was a better movie then anything that has come out in 2010. 

I will be seeing The Expendables hopefully it doesn&#039;t suck. Worried it might be too &quot;tongue and cheeky&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[Vanberge, I love you.  I don&#039;t know if you noticed, but Hollywood consistently centers movies around High school age.  There is a reason for that.  it&#039;s not anything new either.  Examples include any ski resort movie, Ferris, 10 things, Scream, etc.  I honestly don&#039;t think that in any given year you will find fewer movie starring &quot;teens&quot; that any other movie.  We just notice it more now, because we are old and hate everything of the generation immediately after ours.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kramer, I agree that it was a good/funny movie.  I wasn&#039;t really saying the movies are good or bad ( I liked Transformers also) - but I have begun to take issue with the fact that all movies center around high schoolers.

Superbad is still in that category.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Van, I hope you are right. There aren&#039;t very many good, manly action movies made anymore.

I do take exception with you including Superbad in your teeny bopper movie list though. Superbad is fucking hilarious.]]></description>
