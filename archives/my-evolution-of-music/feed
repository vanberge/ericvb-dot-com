					<description><![CDATA[Kramer,
If you give a &quot;thumbs down&quot; to Bob marley, it wont play him again.

If it did happen to play him again, and you gave him another thumbs down - then it will NEVER play Bob Marley again unless you specifically added him to your station.

:-P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pandora is pretty cool. My only real complaint is that it always thinks I want to listen to Bob Marley. No idea how it goes from Skynyrd to Marley, but otherwise it&#039;s great.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I have been tagging along on this journey and I think Pandora is maybe my 2nd best choice, with Rhapsody being the first. It is not free though, $9.99/month but they have like 7 million tracks and you can build your own library - add the artists &#038; albums that you want to play and then it&#039;s like iTunes &quot;for the cloud&quot;. You can play the full album whenever you want, skip around the track, there are no ads, and there are mobile players for iPod/iPhone and one coming for Blackberry.

Plus I found a place called Rhobbler - http://www.rhobbler.com/ - which will check your Rhapsody feed of recently listened music and scrobble it to Last.fm!

I&#039;m still on the 14-day free trial for Rhapsody, we&#039;ll see how much I listen to it. I added all my top artists as seen by Last.fm in to Rhapsody and am playing through that. Pretty cool so far. Web-based player too, or you can install the app on up to 3 computers. Not sure why you&#039;d want the app instead of the little web-based player, but whatever. I haven&#039;t checked it out yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Damnit I forgot to mention this. On iTunes I actually like one of the metal stations Chronix Radio under Radio &#062; Hard Rock/Metal

There are three stations sometimes when I&#039;m away from my music library I&#039;ll toggle between them. The advertisements have increased but they are no way as intrusive as 360 last.fm and way better then broadcast radio.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Before you sell them vanberge if you have some that are complete I would buy them from you I&#039;m sure you have a few I wouldn&#039;t mind having. I&#039;ve been buying a few cd&#039;s here and there but only one or two a year as an average for the last 5+ years.

I love my iPod and I was in the same boat as you vanberge were I lost touch with music and I had to make some changes. Since I don&#039;t live with vanbergs anymore I never know any of the new good shit that comes out so every once in awhile I try to check out something new I just started that in the last month.

When I drive now as in the last year my driving as about doubled I always listen to podcasts in the car and that was a great decision. The radio is terrible I got way to stuck on listening to sports radio that is filled with advertisements and podcasts I can listen to anything I find interesting while I drive to work. At the least I spend an hour a day in the car so that was a good change.

Since you gave pandora such a good recommendation I will need to check it out. I tried it once without registering as we have discussed so I will need to make an account and try it out. 

I also tried the 360 last.fm solution that honestly is cool but the advertisements kill it. The increase in NXE applications and advertisements is one of the reasons I&#039;m letting my XBL account lapse for awhile. 

Good post vanberge brb]]></description>
