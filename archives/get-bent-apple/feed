					<description><![CDATA[I agree the iPod is an irreplaceable device - strictly because of how cars/stereos/TVs all have built in iPod integration these days.

But, at the same time, it sucks that is the case.  I hate being stuck with iTunes to manage my media.  I despise that application.

I will admit that I enjoy and legitimately like my iPod touch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved my mac when it was newer and I love my iPod for running.

My iPod in particular is an indispensable item with truthfully no equal for the money IMHO. 

My next computer more or less will be a mac since building computers take alot of work and arnt&#039; worth saving a few bucks only to ef it up.

					<description><![CDATA[I went to the apple store a few days ago to try the iPad and even though I don&#039;t feel as harshly about the product and apple as a whole as you do I couldn&#039;t think of a use for it in my lifestyle. 

It feels like a vanity loafing content reader/viewer/listener device. Facebook, twittering, youtube, browsing reading...primarily online loafing i couldn&#039;t put it any other way.

It&#039;s not that it&#039;s not a nice. It&#039;s fast it works well looks nice and is functional but really it&#039;s not for everybody.

I unsubscribed to all my apple feeds and the only tech feed I have is techmeme other then a few personal blogs I follow. It honestly is insane who much iphone/ipad crap there is on the net and I agree with you I&#039;m over all the apple hype around their products.

A netbook is great for me. Windows XP that will run just about anything I throw at it with a full keyboard. I would recommend one for anybody on the move or an occasional couch loafer.
