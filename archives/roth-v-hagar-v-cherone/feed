					<description><![CDATA[MickeyVB is dead on.

Although, it was sad that EVH couldn&#039;t make up for the sucktitude of Gary Cherone.

And in my book, Stevie Ray Vaughan &#062; Eddie Van Halen, but that&#039;s another debate for another day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[jja... that comment wasnt even worth leaving.  what a waste of time, effort, and a mysql table row.

Mickeyvb, you are right i doth believe... Even though i would call hagar the better singer, songs like Panama and Runnin&#039; with the devil are truly epic...  And its really EVH&#039;s guitar that does that, not Roth&#039;s vocals/lyrics...  :-P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Truth of the matter is this... The best lead singer of VanHalen was Eddie&#039;s guitar... The vocals in every song created by that group are FAR outweighed by the skillful ministrations of pick and fingering upon &quot;the Soul of Rock&quot; by the skillful master, Eddie... It takes but one riff on that guitar to send chills down the spine of true rock fans.... and that IS what rock is all about.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[who are you vanbergs vanberge and jjafuller

I feel David Lee is more &quot;fun&quot; but Hagar had a better voice.  He was kinda wussy at times but ultimately it&#039;s a tough call. David Lee is more party rock where Hagar is more soulful. 

Cherone is the worst lead singer ever ttyl]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David D. is a better singer than both, i agree... but as he was never the lead man for VH, then that is not a valid point.
