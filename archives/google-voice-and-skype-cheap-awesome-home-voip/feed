					<description><![CDATA[Jones,
Here are answers as best as I can provide:

1.  I don&#039;t pay for Google voice at all, and I just pay for a skype subscription and number.  

2.  No, google voice just forwards calls for you.  I had it set up to forward to my skype number, which would then ring at my computer (if skype was open) or at my phone which i have the skype adapter.

3.  Google voice doesnt work like skype - skype is a calling/voip type service and google voice really only just brokers the calls and connects them.  

4.  I have no idea here and have never travelled internationally.  Skype and Google both publish calling rates (as you can make calls directly within Gmail now, a new feature since this post had been written)

5.  Nope.  Google voice by itself does no calling.  But it can forward to your google talk/gmail which you can use as a voip client (use google talk client or gmail chat)

6.  I am not sure, you&#039;d have to compare skype&#039;s calling rates vs Google talk&#039;s.  Again, Google voice does nothing to make teh call for you; only deliver the calls to whatever service or device you&#039;re using.

Hope those help!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay so this is a little tricky. I have a Skype and a Google voice. I am going to Europe for two weeks and verizon&#039;s international plan&#039;s are quite expensive. Keep in mind I currently own an android as well. So I have many questions.

1.How do you pay for Google Voice and Skype?

2. For google voice do I have to bring my computer?

3. I have heard that in order for google voice to work like skype, I will have to get an app called Groove IP or else google voice will charge on verizon&#039;s international plan. Is this true? If not how can i make international calls to the US straight from my android without using verizon&#039;s minutes?

4. Where can I find rates from Europe to the US or is it the same from US to the European country?

5. Is there a feature on Google Voice that makes it voip?

6. Is skype ultimately cheaper and better for my situation?

Thank You.
Thank you. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In response to Andrea - If you have Skype to only allow calls from people in your contact list you need to turn that off temporarily. The Google number that is calling your Skype land line isn&#039;t in your contacts and isn&#039;t being allowed through.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Andrea,
Do you have a skype online number?
Does your number ever get the phone call? - or, does if fail to hear the key tones as you type the verification code.

I would say try removing/re-adding your phone in the google voice settings page (and use a different name).

If that doesnt work - you might try the forums - there are some prefixes that google voice has difficulty calling sometimes in order to place that verification call.

Good Luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rafael,
Yes - that is the setup I&#039;m still currently using.  works like a charm.

the only thing that I wish were different would be if I could get Skype to show my Google Voice number.  Which should work as Google voice accepts texts from web based sms gateways.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rick,
I think what you&#039;re asking is technically possible - but Google Voice itself doesnt work as a soft voip client.  You&#039;ll need some device for google voice to foward calls to.

But, the setup can be done for totally free using Google Voice with Gizmo5.  I keep meaning to check out Gizmo5 because it&#039;s free and Google Voice can forward to it directly;  but Skype I think is a bit more flexible than Gizmo5.

Hope that helps; and hope you get an invite soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi...Great tips. I just learned of Google Voice and haven&#039;t yet gotten an invite. I&#039;ve been thinking of using Skype for most calls but they don&#039;t yet offer numbers in my area (Maine) and I don&#039;t want every call to be long distance. But tell me if Skype is necessary to do what you want with Google Voice. If you have free friends calls via Verizon or yes you can get 5 from Sprint too, if you use the Google Voice number as one of them will this give you free calls to that number without having to pay for Skype, then still use the adapter and call features of Google Voice...Just trying to figure out what may work and you seem to have a good sense...Thanks]]></description>
