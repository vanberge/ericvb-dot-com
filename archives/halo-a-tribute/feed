					<description><![CDATA[http://halo.xbox.com/en-us//abouthalo/timeline

I believe in years time the game takes place the same year as Halo 1 so the lead in to Halo 1 I&#039;m sure to a degree will feel weird. 

Prequels always have this problem. How does Chief not have armor abilities where the same Spartans in reach have jetpacks and sprinting? Who knows lol nothing makes sence at all.

					<description><![CDATA[Your post brings me back in the day when Kramer was the first of us to have XB1 and he was talking about Halo and how it never meant shit to me. When I finally took the plunge and played Halo 1 I was always impressed how the game could convey a situation that is bigger then one person. As a medium video games have never been good at that. In a movie special effects can in seconds show you a war or struggle where in every frame can seem perilous. In a book just a paragraph can paint a picture of a war torn land and hopeless times.

In a videogame the medium has limits where in most cases for hours it needs in real time to not break that fantasy. Most games can feel like one encounter after the next rather then a stream of war. Halo 1 and 3 in particular has done a good job of giving you Master Chief but then taking it a step back to show you the damage of a war.

Regardless Bungie pretty much rules. They have been able for over 10 years continue building off Halo 1 into Halo Reach giving us a series of campaigns that thankfully will always be re-playable in the future. With Microsoft owning the future of the Halo franchise after Reach the impending Halo 4 taking Chief into the Xbox 720 might be shaky but I agree Halo 1-3 will always be a big part of my 20&#039;s.

I am glad you enjoyed the Harry Potter series as we have discussed at length I couldn&#039;t stomach the first book thus never watched anything else so sadly I will default to disagreeing with you on that notion but everything else is pretty much dead on.

Don&#039;t sleep on Reach either the campaign I think is going to be really good and from what I&#039;ve heard it should be a strong lead into Halo 1 AKA my belief is Chief will be in it somehow.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Of course I knew this would be hijacked by that comparison...

Nobody that hasn&#039;t read the books can criticize the comparison.  There are honestly alot of parallels between the Matrix and Harry potter....  Obviously the setting and plot are different, but they both centralize around a &quot;chosen one&quot; that has to save the world.

The first 2 books suck... I read them only because I was working in layaway at Meijer.  But, as Harry grows, so does the storyline.  It becomes much darker and much more intense.

Now that we have cleared that up - are there any comments regarding the actual subject matter of this post?  lol.  :-*]]></description>
