					<description><![CDATA[I debated heavily about JB.  I wanted to put bauer on there due to his former leader status (in CTU and CTU field ops).  But he is not currently in a leadership role, so I made the difficult choice to remove him from this list.

Vanbergs, &quot;Ug&quot; was the leader of camp &quot;onnawanna&quot; - not Robert James Budnick.  But you did put some good ones on your list. 

I think flo did the top 10 bad asses if i&#039;m not mistaken.  That would be excellent subject matter to be revisited.]]></description>

Richard Belding - Principal in Saved by the Bell
Marky Mark - Leader of the Four Brothers
Jack Nicholson - Leader of Boston Organized Crime in The Departed
Jimmy - Leader of Super Mario Bros. 3 and &quot;California&quot; in The Wizard
Ren - Leader of Ren and Stimpy
Vanbergs - Leader of the Knockout Matches
Bobby Budnick - Leader of Camp Onnawanna
And finally...

Big Boss - Leader of a World Where Soldiers are Necessary.]]></description>
