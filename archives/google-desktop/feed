Also make sure to check your spotlight settings.  I&#039;ve ran into that problem to  and the answer was mostly either folder permissions or I removed a category from my search results.  Also there is a program called Onyx that will allow you to reset your spotlight index...that could help as well.

					<description><![CDATA[Vista has the microsoft search built in - yes.  It&#039;s pretty good.  The version for XP is better because you can put a search toolbar on the start bar.  Vista&#039;s is not quite as easily accessible.

I believe google desktop for windows will search network shares; but I think it is an option that you have to &#039;turn on&#039;.  Not sure about &#039;teh&#039; mac version]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your doggie is so cute.  She will thrive in a new home and will have to learn to be a Van...aka eating everything in reach.

I am also glad google released a application you enjoy.  There is a mac version of google desktop but i don&#039;t really see a use for it.  For the rare times I use search I&#039;ve found spotlight or quicksliver to fit my needs.  Doesn&#039;t vista have an updated search?

Also does google desktop search network shares?  Spotlight doesn&#039;t do that much to my frustration but Leopard will add that functionally.
