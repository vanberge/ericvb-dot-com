					<description><![CDATA[disclaimer: i work for splunk.

Thanks for the kind words about splunk.  If you would rather not install multiple software applications, you can actually use splunk to collect data with wmi as well.

Here is some information on setting up windows data inputs:

And a video all about setting up splunk for windows is here:

In our 4.0 version of the product (currently in beta) you will be able to do a lot more of that setup through the UI.]]></description>
