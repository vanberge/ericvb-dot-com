					<description><![CDATA[Robert,
For me it&#039;s the same workflow as a tabbed browser.  I&#039;d rather not be alt-tabbing through every browser window.  I regularly have 10+ ssh sessions going at once, so I&#039;d rather have them organized in a tabbed interface.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m using putty with MTputty with ppk keys. So you need pageant and puttygen.
Then you can have multi-tab with password-less and hotkeys.
I think Kitty could work with MTputty but havent tried that.

smartTTY is really good, it does what mtputty+putty do with tabs and has password authentication.
The drawback is that its takes a few steps to a different  server to another tab.
In addition you cant change color, I&#039;m not a fan of black terminal. 
Setterm doesnt seem to work with smartTTY, so your stuck with black.

I&#039;ve used nremote, but this uses putty+puttygen for authentication and is not as flexibile as smarTTY

Tried kitty, password feature is nice, but doesnt have tabs :D
Tried Terminals, but buggy trying to setup new connections
Tera Term doesnt work on my win8

MobaXterm free version is pretty good, however doesnt have inbuilt password, but with putty+puttygen can work well. supports everything the other versions and more.

My picks
Well you need to have putty installed with all of the session and keys that are generated with puttygen or pageant. If you need tabbed sessions.

Then for the front-end, 
MobaXterm or 
smartTTY]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
is there splitted view possibility to watch more terminal window on one tab ( like in superputty? )
Sometimes I need to run e.g. tail -f  on log files on more servers simultaneously, as I see, if I need to watch all the 4 outputs, I have to switch between the tabs manually.
Thanks!]]></description>
