					<description><![CDATA[Vanlandw - if you loathe IT, then what is your ultimate &#039;dream job&#039; ??   and why did you go to school for IT?  :-P

jjafuller - even senior software engineering would make me want to ingest toxic agents.  Even if it were as high a level as diagramming flo charts of modules... then passing my chart off to some other team that writes the modules. 

i really just hate the process of creating software.   I suppose the one plus side is that it allows you to be somewhat creative in how you do things...  it&#039;s hard to get creative doing access lists on cisco firewalls  :-(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[almost anybody in IT in GR is underpaid...mostly due to cost of living...so i&#039;m sure a similar position almost anywhere else in the country would yield more pay

also i can&#039;t imagine anything in IT being the best job in the country...i would imagine most health care workers teachers professors have a much higher job satisfaction.  but most IT workers do get paid well for sitting on their asses half the time. thus I&#039;m sure that is a big factor

but this is coming from somebody who pretty much loathes IT but gg regardless.  i&#039;m glad you are happy about your position :-*]]></description>
