					<description><![CDATA[Damnit. I bid $50 on your lots, assuming that I would just drive up the bid price for you. Worked find the PSX titles. But I am apparently the high bidder on the GBA titles. If I win I demand free shipping. :razz:]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just clicked on your adverts vanberge number four. I also hope your &quot;lots&quot; bring in lots of money :-*

Personally I&#039;m a pack rat but in reality I don&#039;t really have that much stuff. Also I like all the stuff that I have.  Other then if i was in absolute dire need of money I would never sell my video games. I&#039;ve sold stuff in the past (videogames, CD&#039;s, hardware, ect) and almost always ended up regretting it.  At my grandmothers are all my old basketball cards and tons of old videogame stuff.  When I finally own a house I will consolidate and get rid of stuff I feel I don&#039;t need.]]></description>
