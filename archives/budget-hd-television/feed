					<description><![CDATA[Yeah i know what you mean... Alot of the channels I pick up seem to never have real HD..

I pick up probably 15 channels total with 5 or 6 having HD programming consistently.

Not too bad though...  What kind of antenna did you get?  I got an RCA uhf/vhf with the adjustable gain for each.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[right on dude, I got an early xmas present in the form of a 27-inch magnavox LCD HDTV with built-in tuner and DVD player (standard definition).

I went out and bought a 30-dollar radioshack indoor adjustable gain vhf/uhf antenna and now bask in the ultimate in crispness and color of our local HD broadcasters.

What really irks me though is the simple fact that not every show is shot in HD and hence, not living up to my tv set&#039;s potential. horrible.

I have decided not to upgrade my dish network reciever to the HD version as it adds like $25 to my monthly bill and the multitude of HD that I recieve in gaines township is awesomeness enough.]]></description>
