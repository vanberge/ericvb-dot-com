					<description><![CDATA[Lakitu is such an asshole that took me forever.  Really my mario skills are quite pathetic now to be honest. New Mario Brothers really bones you on how easy it is.  The older Mario games are tough I don&#039;t know how children could ever defeat those games.  I would love to give a 10 year old kid a copy of Zelda 1 and without cheating and have them figure out how to beat the game it&#039;s impossible without cheating or looking it up. Nintendo are some crafty assholes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever forget the trials and tribulations vanlandw faced and eventually overcame to successfully garner a few dozen extra lives.  Lakitu was a motherFUCKER to vanlandw!

Also, Rush 2 stunt mode is breathtakingly awesome.]]></description>
