					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if Obama drinks, but I bet he would bum a smoke off of you.

I was not impressed with the booing during John McCain&#039;s speech last night.  Especially since I thought it was a very good speech, both him and Obama did excellent jobs with their speeches.
