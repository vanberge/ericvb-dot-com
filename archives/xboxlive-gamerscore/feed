					<description><![CDATA[Fun is fun dude. If you guys had fun boosting who gives a rats I think it&#039;s hysterical. 


&quot;Oddly enough I blame Vanlandw at least partially for starting this&quot;

That made me laugh. Yeah I prob will have a hard time catching you for awhile depending on what I play. Mostly your goal should be defeating JJA and his team of brothers.

					<description><![CDATA[Lol.  Sure Vo.

I&#039;ll also give you Avatar that&#039;s an easy 1k.
You just can&#039;t give any of them to Vanlandw.  Part of this undertaking is to catch his gamerscore while he is away on vacation.  :-P]]></description>
