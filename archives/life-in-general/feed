					<description><![CDATA[you are so dumb sometimes vanbergs.  you argue just for the point of arguing.  

&quot;Jigsaw&quot; Mc Oldie is hardly a horror movie icon.  And i didnt say that Saw II needed to have &#039;intense character development&#039;...  But i should have been able to remember the main characters name.  EF you vanbergs.

&quot;Freddy vs. jason is a sweet movie.&quot;  .   .  .

The shining is a good horror movie.  You remember the character&#039;s names.  Saw II was not a good movie.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Clearly, the fact that you could not name any of the characters&#039; names is not a flaw of the film, it&#039;s a horror movie.  The main character in the movie was Jigsaw, it was pretty much a character study of him, and Eric (Donnie&#039;s character) was secondary.  The other characters&#039; purposes were simply to die, so if you wanted a movie with intense character development, I&#039;d suggest not watching a HORROR movie, because they are traditionally not known for their hefty amounts of such a development.  Furthermore, we as viewers know little to nothing about Donnie Wahlberg&#039;s character.  

Also, all the characters that you mentioned from other movies are pretty much &quot;icons&quot;, not mere characters.  Jigsaw is becoming a horror icon as well, he&#039;s the man, and I&#039;m saddened by the fact that you did not enjoy that movie.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[vanberge don&#039;t pull a rusty and take your site down. just update like once a week it&#039;s good for the mind.

Saw 2 was &quot;ok&quot;.  I liked a few of the scenes and was a good popcorn movie.  Vanbergs is going to be angry you did not enjoy this film.

AHOV was pretty good.  I liked the &quot;action&quot; scenes as they were quick but effective.  Also there was full frontal and a movie gets a thumbs up by me for displaying some famous bush :-[
