					<description><![CDATA[The contrast of blue/white can be a little much, but i&#039;m not changing it.

If you have an LCD or laptop turn on fontsmoothing / cleartype fonts and that is much much better.  :-P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You have made a very convincing argument, and I think you should read the feature on ign.com dubbed &quot;Sopranos Finale Roundtable Discussion&quot;.  They have a very good conversation on the pros and cons of the episode.

I guess I would like it more if I didn&#039;t have such high expectations.  The Sopranos has always been a very mature show and one that has taken a lot of chances.  I was really hoping for them to take just one more chance with a finale that no other show could have dreamt of doing: and that is either Tony prevailing or reaching the end of his downfall.  

I guess one could argue that the actual finale included both of those to an extent, but why not show it?  Why leave it up to interpretation from the viewer?  I enjoy film and tv analysis as much as the next van, but for an ending to one of the best shows ever, I felt that more punctuation was necessary.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if i&#039;m as enthusiastic about the ending as you are but I understand it I&#039;ve come to terms with it and the more I think about it the more I do like it.  I&#039;m not bitter with how it ended but my post summed up my feelings but for the most part I agree with you. Prior to the episode I went in thinking it was going to be to a degree anti-climatic, but expecting maybe a twist.  

You summed up everything very good with your words and we are vans so our opinions are the only ones that matter.
