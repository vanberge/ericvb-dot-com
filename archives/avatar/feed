					<description><![CDATA[The matrix CLEARLY gives the backstory/setup mid-way through the film when Neo meets Morpheus.  

The terminator&#039;s backstory/setup is told throughout the film via Kyle Reese&#039;s flashbacks, his mentoring and &quot;soldierization&quot; of Sarah Conner, and finally through Sarah Conner&#039;s narratives.

I&#039;m not even going to respond to the Lion King/Gleaming the cube references.  

Interestingly enough you have chosen some movies with very strong, dedicated scenes that VISUALLY show the viewer the backstory and plot setup... which Avatar undeniably does the exact opposite of.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t understand your &quot;rushed setup&quot; claim.  Was there not enough back story at the beginning?  Did it drop you too far into the story too early?  I can&#039;t see how that could be an issue, because that would be like saying The Matrix had a rushed setup, because it shows Trinity running on a wall and defying physics.  If it&#039;s setup that you want, should Neo have had his discussion with Morpheus about the Matrix at the beginning?

Was The Terminator too rushed in setup because a nude Arnold materializes in an orb amid an electronic storm of lightning in the opening scenes?

Was The Lion King rushed in setup because it started with Simba being displayed to the entire African animal population, rather than showing Mufasa and Sarabi fucking to create him?!

WAS GLEAMING THE CUBE RUSHED BECAUSE IT STARTED WITH THEM SKATEBOARDING?!  HOW DID THEY LEARN THOSE TRICKS?!  ANSWER ME  &#062;_&#060;

					<description><![CDATA[Vans sometimes disagree on things...  It&#039;s just the way of life.

I&#039;d love some more insights from Jja as well here; he seemed to indicate that he bumped it higher due to it&#039;s Sci-fi base...

I think we can all agree that the films visuals, effects, and composition are top notch.  So let&#039;s focus on the positives.  :-D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After finishing sweeping a few moments after my previous comment a flood of thoughts came upon me. This entire comment trail is just a complete testament to the power of media. Looking at the thoughts and feelings brought forth by movies like Avatar and games like Call of Duty 4 it&#039;s a powerful thing to have such strong opinions on a narative or experience. 

Thinking about the history of P4P/ericvb.com I don&#039;t think another movie has driven you to write a proper opinionated review. Even on my site I hardly ever feel the need to put something down on &quot;wax&quot; about video games but two games I ultimately didn&#039;t enjoy much drove me to delve deep into myself and proclaim to the world how I felt about them. 

Vanberge, Avatar has truly driven you to insanity and it&#039;s fantastic isn&#039;t it?

					<description><![CDATA[I do have to agree with vanbergs you, vanberge, did go into the film already believing you wouldn&#039;t like it. The thing is that is utterly understandable. I am reading a book now knowing full well I&#039;m not going to like it. I&#039;ve played games (famously Final Fantasy X to completion) again I knowing I&#039;m not going to like. Actually before I saw Avatar I was actually really happy vanbergs liked it because our tastes are normally pretty similar and seeing that Ebert fave it four stars again was a huge win as again I do normally agree with him on movies. 

Going into the movie with higher hopes and actually hardly knowing anything about it as I didn&#039;t watch the trailers and having high word of mouth I think helped my experience. 

Sadly as known my theater experience dimmed my enjoyment but still watching the movie there were points where the thrill ride did get to me and in a perfect world I would have been able to just watch it at home and my enjoyment would have been even higher. 

If JJA posts again I bet you he will say something where he doesn&#039;t mind spoilers and that wouldn&#039;t have changed your mind but I agree with vanbergs. Imagine if you knew in advanced that Nina was going to get murdered by Jack? One of the best moments of my entire life wouldn&#039;t have been the same knowing a week in advanced it was going to happen.

But again I do agree with vanberge on almost story points oddly enough. I&#039;m just completely torn on Avatar but I would say I &quot;liked&quot; it without question but this is coming from somebody who still likes season 6 of 24 even though there are CLEARLY problems with it and that season is universally panned and loathed.

					<description><![CDATA[A couple clarifications:
I don&#039;t hate this movie...
The two star rating in Netflix signifies a &quot;dont like&quot;. 

Also; my wife fell asleep for 30 minutes of the movie.  lol?

The amount of advertising and buzz for this film has built a level of hype that this film is just not deserving of in my opinion. 

Note that I maintain I will be re-watching this film when all the attention/buzz has blown over.  I&#039;m maybe with Vanlandw that a 2nd viewing is needed to confirm my feelings on the picture.

I don&#039;t know if that will change my thoughts or not - my suspicions are that it will not]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your comment is too long.

You tell me that the setup of this film didn&#039;t feel rushed?  

It felt incredibly rushed.

The story IS unoriginal.  The Characters ARE typical.  The CGI/Effects are the ONLY redeeming quality.

Unless James Cameron authored the software environment in which to render said CGI, that is not enough.

If I &#039;knew I was going to hate it&quot; I would not have spent 30 dollars seeing it in 3D, I&#039;m pretty sure...  So that&#039;s a ridiculous claim.

As Vanlandw says - they have marine mercenaries to back up scientists??  

Jake Sulley&#039;s narratives/monologues giving his point of view and status are nearly completely devoid of any feeling.  A marine getting injured could very easily maintain an attitude of &quot;I am happy to have served my country; this comes with the territory&quot; - so it&#039;s not fair to just assume that he&#039;s angry/jaded.

At this point we are over-analyzing a &quot;shock and awe&quot; film created with a mediocre storyline and mediocre plot; Just told via prettier pictures.

I&#039;M SORRY IF THATS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME.  &#062;:O
