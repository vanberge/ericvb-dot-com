					<description><![CDATA[vanberge... get a clue... a &#039;van&#039; mafia could not be of Dutch origin, even though it sounds correct. True van lineage is begat from Belgian ancestry, and not from klompen-stompen, tulip-tippin, windmill-whirlin, street-sweepin, or long-blue-dress&#039;in descendency... Wazza matta wit you???

					<description><![CDATA[You can also find The Sopranos for a reasonable price, around 50 bucks, on ebay if you look hard enough.

					<description><![CDATA[A dutch mafia eh?  You are aware that it would all take place in a bank, where bills are counted, recounted, and then placed neatly into a savings account.  Then the hollanders would make pancakes in a windmill while carving shoes out of old birch trees, rolling their hair into pigtails, and wearing ankle-length blue dresses with frilly lace arm cuffs.  Fuck the dutch.  My boss tonight even said &quot;The Dutch are cheap and aren&#039;t to be trusted&quot;, I laughed quite heartily.  

And yes, your butthole is not good vanberge.]]></description>
