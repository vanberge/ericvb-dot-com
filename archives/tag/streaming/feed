										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve completely embraced &#8220;streaming&#8221; as my primary ingestion path for nearly all media formats for quite some time.</p>
<p>As far as movies go, I&#8217;ve been a member of Netflix since July of 2007.  I haven&#8217;t bought a DVD since.  I&#8217;ve never even considered a Blu-ray player or owning Blue-ray disks.  &#8220;Stream it or die&#8221; is my motto.  From the music side, digital music owns my entire landscape.  I haven&#8217;t bought a physical CD since 2001 when Tool&#8217;s Lateralus came out.  Whether it&#8217;s MP3s in my car or streaming from my smartphone or my computer at work &#8211; I&#8217;ve never looked back at CD&#8217;s and never will.  Overall, I&#8217;ve really just embraced all things the streaming at large: Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, Pandora, Last.fm, Grooveshark, iHeartRadio &#8211; the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Streaming media is certainly in an early stage in its life.  I&#8217;d call it late infancy or early toddler.  Although the adoption rate for streaming has been thrust into popularity by Netflix and others; the media conglomerates that license and allow distribution of this content have been slow to adapt.  This results in only &#8220;some&#8221; content being available for &#8220;some&#8221; time before it expires.  Meanwhile, the services are offered at drastically reduced rates to customers because the media libraries are far from fully stocked.  I&#8217;ll be the first person to admit that the Netflix unlimited streaming plan is worth way more than it&#8217;s 7.99 a month rate.  But quite simply, Netflix can&#8217;t charge much more than that unless they are able to offer new releases and/or a more complete library.</p>
<p>Netflix has started to attempt shaping the industry as it needs to be shaped by increasing the prices on their streaming/DVD combo plans.  Ultimately, this forces most consumers to choose between streaming or DVD rentals by mail &#8211; and I feel that the vast majority of customers choose streaming.  I don&#8217;t fully support this move with such a gaping lack of new and high end releases in their streaming library, and I didn&#8217;t like that they did it in such a &#8220;bulk&#8221; fashion.  But, in reality this is not Netflix&#8217;s fault.  I was originally INFURIATED with the combo plan price increase and the seemingly forced migration to streaming-only.  But the truth is, this is a move that is necessary.</p>
<p>The industry is resisting the adaption of streaming; and it&#8217;s been even further compounded now that Netflix and Starz have been unable to reach an agreement to renew their contract.  But this was all the same with the MP3 era &#8211; it took record companies YEARS to adjust to a digital age.  Looks like the movie studios haven&#8217;t learned anything.  Nobody wants to go pay 12 bucks to see 20 minutes of ads and previews and a movie that they can stream from their home 3 months later at a much cheaper rate without any ad/previews.  People aren&#8217;t going to keep buying 5 editions of the same movie on DVD/Blu-ray (DIRECTOR&#8217;S CUT.  ULTIMATE EXTENDED EDITION.  ULTRA DEATH PERISH EDITION).</p>
<p>Streaming media is changing the movie industry.  The customer holds a lot more of the cards, and at some point you better realize it.</p>
