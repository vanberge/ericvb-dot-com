										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it was fun while it lasted everyone&#8230;</p>
<p>Setting up everyone&#8217;s favorite BBS game to give us all a blast from the past and a taste of the good ol&#8217; days was certainly a worthy experience.  But, with lowered attendance, lack of interests, and everyone just generally being too busy, I have made the decision to decommission LoRD.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who joined in and signed up &#8211; it really was a great time while we were all playing.  Highlights for me include the <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/lord-complete-espionage-conspiracy">utter espionage engagement with Vanlandw</a>, <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/lord-jja-brb">various fights</a> <a href="http://they.misled.us/archives/1320">against</a> rival <a href="http://they.misled.us/archives/1328">Jjafuller</a>, and being one of only 3 people to <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/lord-defeated">slay the beast and complete the game</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, I offer a bullet point listing of things taken away from this experience:</p>
<ul>
<li> Vanlandw is a noob.</li>
<li> Nobody cares about your singing, Seth Able</li>
<li> Violet is promiscuous</li>
<li> Death Knights pwn noobs</li>
<li> People should just &#8220;not gone into the forest&#8221; in the first place</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/24-season-8">As I previously posted</a>; I have been very unhappy with this season of 24.  More so than in any other previous season, and with greater and greater intensity.</p>
<p>I had decided about 5 episodes in that I was giving myself half of the season; and if 24 did not improve or show signs of turn-around, then I was going to cease watching it forever. (as Vanlandw has stated; I have said this before &#8211; sometimes it&#8217;s been an idle threat.  But, I did not and will not ever finish watching Season 6).  Well, episode 12 came and went; and all I got was more and more angry at how ridiculous the show has become.   So, while episode 13 was airing last week, I played my new Nintendo Wii.   While episode 14 was airing yesterday, I was watching &#8220;Religulous&#8221;.  Let me tell you, it feels SO good to disconnect from this show.  I have jumped ship and I will never ever make any effort to swim back.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but feel a little bit of sadness here, but the more I think about it &#8211;  the more my sadness becomes anger.  24 was a truly ground-breaking series and was undeniably top notch television in it&#8217;s prime.  There are few other television programs that can rival 24 in it&#8217;s golden years &#8211; but the simple fact is that Fox just utterly destroyed this program.  It changed from a gritty drama to a laughable ratings-whore composed of LITERALLY trash.  Well, Fox, the public noticed&#8230;  You managed to alienate and infuriate the most loyal fan-base of all time;  Even they can only keep their hopes and dreams up for so long, and Season 8 has proven to be the last straw.  The ratings have dropped, the quality has continued it&#8217;s downward tailspin, meanwhile the only thing that has gone up has been the show&#8217;s production budget.   Finally; arguably 3 years too late, Fox has decided to put 24 out of it&#8217;s misery and cancel it.</p>
<p>So, what went wrong?  What happend?  Why did 24 limp into mediocrity?  Let&#8217;s run a comparative; Looking at a semi-similar series: &#8220;The Shield&#8221;  on FX.</p>
<p>The Shield is also a gritty drama.  The Shield has a similar &#8220;bad ass&#8221; main character &#8211; Vic Mackey.  And, it has similar struggles of that main character as their job and life effect their friendships and families.  Yes, the settings and plots are sometimes very different &#8211; but 24 could have learned alot from how The Shield bowed out.  The most important thing:  The writers of The Shield never changed the heart of their show.  They never changed plots to try and cater to the masses.  In fact, they gave us scenes that we didn&#8217;t even want to see (Lem).  They gave us a final two seasons that were literally gut-wrenching, made me feel sick to watch at times, and genuinely brought me to tears.  It was utter downfall&#8230;</p>
<p>But, it was a most epic and decisive series finale as can possibly be had.</p>
<p>24, your death is brought not by skilled and emotional content like The Shield; but rather by your own greed and lust for your success.  The higher your ratings went, the further and more over the top you felt you needed to push the show.  It didn&#8217;t take long for you to push too far, to the point where it became a cheesy satire of it&#8217;s former self.  You searched for meaning in more/larger explosions, exploitations of your main character, and trying to find the charm you once had.  You killed off the characters that everyone liked while keeping around all the characters that everyone hates.  You bring in new characters to fill in the same old roles.   You put a mask on recycled plot lines hoping nobody will notice, while you combine them and cram more of them in each season.  Well, you did it &#8211; and you failed.</p>
<p>You straight up blew it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re on your death bed and I&#8217;m not coming to visit you.  I don&#8217;t want to see you this way, and I have no desire to see how you meet your end.  I don&#8217;t owe you ANYTHING.  You un-deniably suck.  You managed to turn away your best friends at the most critical part of your life, and as far as I&#8217;m concerned you can fall into oblivion alone; reaping exactly what you have sown.</p>
<p>Good riddance; gtfo</p>
