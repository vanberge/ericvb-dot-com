										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back when I was playing through Grand Theft Auto IV, <a href="http://vanlandw.com">Vanlandw</a> and I were trying very hard to find the sound samples used when the player successfully completed a mission&#8230;</p>
<p>For those that may not know what I&#8217;m talking about:  Depending which mission you were playing in GTA 4, one of three various sound samples would play upon successful completion &#8211; and they were all very catchy, cool sounding clips.  Mainly, our thought was that they would make great ring tones on a mobile phone.</p>
<p>After I had long since given up, Vanlandw did actually manage to find and make one of the sounds into an mp3 ringtone &#8211; for which I give him immense credit.  I&#8217;ve used that very ring tone off and on as my ringer for some time.   Today, I came across a youtube vid that sampled all of the various mission complete sounds (even 2 additional &#8220;sad&#8221; mission ending sounds that I didn&#8217;t think about).  The sampling on the two &#8220;sad&#8221; clips is kinda shaky &#8211; you can hear traffic and footsteps from the game, so I elected not to use those.  But, I decided to use some rip/dub/export awesomeness to get the audio into a usable mp3 format and create a ringer for each different sound clip.   Check them out below, or just click on the &#8220;Files&#8221; tab up above and find them under Ringtones.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/misc/Ringtones/GTA4_miss_comp1.mp3">GTA4 &#8211; Mission Complete tone 1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/misc/Ringtones/GTA4_miss_comp1-double.mp3">GTA4 &#8211; Mission Complete tone 1</a> (double ring)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/misc/Ringtones/GTA4_miss_comp2.mp3">GTA4 &#8211; Mission Complete tone 2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/misc/Ringtones/GTA4_miss_comp3.mp3">GTA4 &#8211; Mission Complete tone 3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>#1 is my fav, I think&#8230;</p>
<p>****Update****<br />
Noticed these ring-tones were very quiet when played on a cell phone &#8211; So I&#8217;ve uploaded amplified versions &#8211; as well as a double ring version of the 1st tone.</p>
<p>YEAH</p>
