										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have recently been working alot with HP-UX. Â A big part of that work relates to managing Serviceguard clusters, something I have had little previous experience doing. Â It was a challenge for me to find any sort of a quick start guide or simplified steps towards building a Serviceguard cluster, so I wanted to combine all the pieces and parts I have Googled and man-paged together so the next person can hopefully find this useful.</p>
<p>Prerequisites</p>
<ul>
<li>Two hosts (nodes) running the same build of HP-UX</li>
<li>Same version of Serviceguard installed</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the steps to build a ServiceGuard cluster on HP-UX 11.31</p>
<ol>
<li>Run <strong>csshsetup &lt;secondary nodename&gt;</strong> on your primary node, enter the root password.</li>
<li>Run <strong>csshsetup &lt;primary nodename&gt;</strong> on your secondary node, enter the root password.</li>
<li>Run <strong>cmpreparecl -n &lt;primarynode&gt; -n &lt;secondarynode&gt;Â </strong>to set up the Serviceguard relationship settings</li>
<li>Create a basic cluster configuration file by running <strong>cmquerycl -v -C &lt;clustername.ascii&gt; -n &lt;primarynode&gt; -n &lt;secondarynode&gt;</strong></li>
<li>Edit the newly created ascii file to your specific needs, noting things like:
<ul>
<li>Cluster name</li>
<li>IPs</li>
<li>Quorum server hosts or volume group</li>
<li>Cluster shares storage/volume groups</li>
<li>Take some extra time here, this is really important!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Validate the cluster config file by running <strong>cmcheckconf -C &lt;clustername.ascii&gt;</strong>. Â Deal with any warnings or errors that are of concern. Â (The setup will apply with warnings, but they should still be considered)</li>
<li>Apply the config and create the cluster by running <strong>cmapplyconf -v -C &lt;clustername.ascii&gt;</strong>.</li>
<li>Review all the output and make sure the cluster relationship was successful; run <strong>cmviewcl</strong>Â which should show both nodes, likely in a &#8220;down&#8221; state</li>
<li>You can bring up the nodes now if you want, starting with the primary node by running <strong>cmrunnode &lt;nodename&gt;</strong>. Run <strong>cmviewcl</strong> again to check and make sure everything looks good. Â You&#8217;ll see a cluster, and nodes but no packages yet</li>
<li>Now its time to create some packages. Â This is where the real meat of Serviceguard starts to develop, so pay special attention to these configurations
<ul>
<li>You can create a very basic template config by running <strong>cmmakepkg -m sg/failover -m sg/package_ip &lt;packageconfig.conf&gt;</strong> &#8211; which would give you failover and IP capabilities</li>
<li>Or, you could create a &#8220;full&#8221; config by running <strong>cmmakepkg -m sg/all &lt;packageconfig.conf&gt;</strong>.</li>
<li>Edit the package config file to suit your needs, consider adding:Â IP Addresses, package names, filesystems and volume groups</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you&#8217;ve got your package config file in order, you can validate it by running <strong>cmcheckconf -v -P &lt;packageconfig.conf&gt;</strong>.</li>
<li>Review your output and check for any errors. Â If you&#8217;re satisfied with everything, go ahead and apply the config to create your cluster package! Â <strong>cmapplyconf -P &lt;packageconfig.conf&gt;</strong></li>
<li>Run a <strong>cmviewcl</strong> again to check out the cluster now, you should see your newly created cluster package, in a down state.</li>
<li>To Â bring the package online, runÂ <strong>cmrunpkg -n &lt;nodename&gt; &lt;packagename&gt;</strong>Â and then make sure it is up and running (with another <strong>cmviewcl</strong>)</li>
<li>Optionally, you can set the package up for auto run by <strong>cmmodpkg -e &lt;packagename&gt;</strong> to allow it to startup automatically after a failover.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also use the HP systems management homepage to click through the steps of creating a Serviceguard cluster, but really where&#8217;s the fun in that? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>A list of some of the useful commands to use for Serviceguard clusters:</p>
<ul>
<li>cmviewcl</li>
<li>cmquerycl</li>
<li>cmrunpkg</li>
<li>cmhaltpkg</li>
<li>cmrunnode</li>
<li>cmcheckconf</li>
<li>cmapplyconf</li>
<li>cmmakepkg</li>
</ul>
