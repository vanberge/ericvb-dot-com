										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re a Linux user, you will be happy to know that VMware offers a Linux version of it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.vmware.com/support/viewclients/doc/horizon-view-client-linux-release-notes.html">Horizon View client</a>.  However, it&#8217;s a bit of a strange release strategy.  For Ubuntu, my distro of choice, VMware only offers the packages for the LTS versions of the popular OS. This is kind of a bummer because the LTS versions of Ubuntu Linux are only released every 2 years.  I really do not like running an OS that&#8217;s even one release behind.</p>
<p>Well, I decided this just cannot stand.  I wanted to have a working View client on my latest Ubuntu 14.10 release which was not an LTS version.</p>
<p>Google was surprisingly unhelpful here, only really offering suggestions on installing a 32 bit version and changing repositories in your sources.list file.  I did not really want to cross the streams that much on a fresh build, so I decided to try and find a cleaner way to get the Horizon View client installed.  This was actually quite a bit easier than I expected.</p>
<p>The good news is, the packages VMware releases for the LTS versions of Ubuntu can pretty much install on any of the later versions of Ubuntu. Here&#8217;s how I did it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browse to http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/pool/partner/v/vmware-view-client/ from your web browser and download the latest .deb package file.  At the time of this writing, the latest version is 2.2.0 for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS</li>
<li>Open the file with archive manager and click &#8220;Install&#8221;, or install it from command line via
<pre>sudo dpkg -i vmware-view-client_2.2.0-0ubuntu0.14.04_i386.deb</pre>
</li>
<li>The package should auto-resolve some dependencies for you and install successfully.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s it!  You now have the VMware Horizon View client installed on the latest/greatest release of Ubuntu.  It&#8217;s been working great for me, and I hope it works just as well for anyone who comes across this. </p>
