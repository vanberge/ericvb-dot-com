										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[SPOILERS FROM VARIOUS SEASONS INCLUDING SEASON 8.   IF YOU&#8217;VE NOT SEEN EVERY EPISODE OF 24 THEN READ AT YOUR OWN RISK]</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8230;   &#8230;<br />
</strong></p>
<p>24 has been a staple of my adult life.</p>
<p>From watching season 1 on DVD in pretty much a single sitting, to various fights and &#8220;plant activites&#8221; with Vanlandw, the awe-inspiring fate of Nina Meyers, and Edgar&#8217;s famous &#8220;CHLOE?!&#8230; AAARHRH&#8221; scene &#8211; The list of memories goes on and on.</p>
<p>But, for as much amazing and compelling drama as this show has produced; it has produced at least the equal amount of complete BS and sheer annoyance.  This trend seems to be correlated with each new season that has been released; with the exception of perhaps season 5.  With seasons 1 and 2 being near perfection; I think it&#8217;s almost a shame what this show has now become.  So begins my hatred and critique of Season 8.</p>
<p>I somehow managed to watch all of season 7.  I SOMEHOW looked past zombie-Tony.  I somehow looked past the over-use of &#8220;<em>Oh&#8230; Are you going to torture him Jack</em>?&#8221;.  I somehow looked past the constantly changing good/bad/good/bad Tony.  And, finally, I would say I was able to look past the annoying women characters.  Read: President Taylor; Renae; Chloe; President Taylor&#8217;s bitch daughter.  Really, the show is physically incapable of producing a female character that I do not hate with fiery brimstone furiousness.</p>
<p>I was going to try to reserve judgment on this season to let it get at least half way through &#8211; but it&#8217;s just not possible.  The list of complete BS that I feel the need to call out has grown past the tipping point and the spillage shall begin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chloe:  Why this show continues to kill off interesting and relatable characters whilst keeping this permanent annoyance is just beyond me.  I guess it may help female viewers relate to the show, but she adds merely a layer of stupid woman for all the action and real drama to fight through.  I hate Chloe.  In fact, I hate Chloe so much that I have vetoed it as a possible baby name even though it is my wife&#8217;s favorite.</li>
<li>Dana Walsh:  Apparently the top counter terrorism agency in the country just fails year after year to do standard background checking procedures.  I&#8217;m so sick of the mole/badguy/general shady person plot line in 24.  Dana Walsh apparently has some sort of questionable past that she&#8217;s running from.  So, she&#8217;s apparently used her amazing level of intelligence to create a new identity and get a new job with CTU.  Her hair is always waved over one shoulder.  And, her face just really bothers me.  Her existence enrages me even further since she&#8217;s the fiancée of Cole &#8220;Freddy Prinze Jr.&#8221; Ortiz.</li>
<li>Cole &#8220;Freddy Prinze Jr.&#8221; Ortiz: He is played by Freddy Prinze Junior.</li>
<li>Renae Walker:  Imagine this line being spoken in a Swedish Chef type of voice; Cus that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m saying it.  &#8220;Ooooh I&#8217;m Renae Walker and I&#8217;ve had such a tough couple years that now I&#8217;m a female Jack Bauer.&#8221;  Poor Renae.  She had it rough and now she&#8217;s an outcast who gets by and gets things done via her renegade attitude.  24 Doesn&#8217;t need a female Jack Bauer.  She shouldn&#8217;t be on this show in this season.  OH&#8230;. MAN&#8230; THERE IS A RUSSIAN CRIME SYNDICATE INVOLVED AND APPARENTLY THIS FORMER FBI AGENT JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE BEST RUSSIAN UNDER-COVER OPERATIVE ON THE ENTIRE PLANET!&gt;!&gt;!!&gt;!11..1.&gt;.    bs.</li>
<li>CTU Itself:  Chloe.  Mole/badguy.  Blue-tool headsets.  &#8220;We have our suspect, this is the only possible scenario &#8211; even though strong evidence points otherwise&#8221;.  Dumb.</li>
<li>The Plot:  The assassination plot has been done before.  The nuclear threat has been done before.  Apparently now they are mixed into the same season.  Jack can&#8217;t say the work nuclear correctly.  I hate when people say nuke-u-lar.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far I am really not impressed with 24, and I&#8217;m really doubting I&#8217;ll be able to watch it through the rest of this season 8.  CTU feels like a high-school in the valley.  Not a high tech counter-terrorism organization.  This is a pretty big fail.  I don&#8217;t like any of the new characters.  I don&#8217;t like the ones they&#8217;re choosing to bring back.  So far I don&#8217;t like the plot.  The only thing I&#8217;ve enjoyed this season thus far has been Jack&#8217;s kill by way of axe to the chest (Vanlandw where is bauercount seriously!).</p>
<p>In my opinion this show has long since run it&#8217;s course&#8230;  There have been quick glimpses of good television at points over a couple of the most recent seasons &#8211; but overall they have become fewer and farther between each other.  I&#8217;m growing tired of 24, and that is a very difficult thing to pen.</p>
