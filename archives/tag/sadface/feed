										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it was fun while it lasted everyone&#8230;</p>
<p>Setting up everyone&#8217;s favorite BBS game to give us all a blast from the past and a taste of the good ol&#8217; days was certainly a worthy experience.  But, with lowered attendance, lack of interests, and everyone just generally being too busy, I have made the decision to decommission LoRD.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who joined in and signed up &#8211; it really was a great time while we were all playing.  Highlights for me include the <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/lord-complete-espionage-conspiracy">utter espionage engagement with Vanlandw</a>, <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/lord-jja-brb">various fights</a> <a href="http://they.misled.us/archives/1320">against</a> rival <a href="http://they.misled.us/archives/1328">Jjafuller</a>, and being one of only 3 people to <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/lord-defeated">slay the beast and complete the game</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, I offer a bullet point listing of things taken away from this experience:</p>
<ul>
<li> Vanlandw is a noob.</li>
<li> Nobody cares about your singing, Seth Able</li>
<li> Violet is promiscuous</li>
<li> Death Knights pwn noobs</li>
<li> People should just &#8220;not gone into the forest&#8221; in the first place</li>
</ul>
