										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/24-season-8">As I previously posted</a>; I have been very unhappy with this season of 24.  More so than in any other previous season, and with greater and greater intensity.</p>
<p>I had decided about 5 episodes in that I was giving myself half of the season; and if 24 did not improve or show signs of turn-around, then I was going to cease watching it forever. (as Vanlandw has stated; I have said this before &#8211; sometimes it&#8217;s been an idle threat.  But, I did not and will not ever finish watching Season 6).  Well, episode 12 came and went; and all I got was more and more angry at how ridiculous the show has become.   So, while episode 13 was airing last week, I played my new Nintendo Wii.   While episode 14 was airing yesterday, I was watching &#8220;Religulous&#8221;.  Let me tell you, it feels SO good to disconnect from this show.  I have jumped ship and I will never ever make any effort to swim back.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but feel a little bit of sadness here, but the more I think about it &#8211;  the more my sadness becomes anger.  24 was a truly ground-breaking series and was undeniably top notch television in it&#8217;s prime.  There are few other television programs that can rival 24 in it&#8217;s golden years &#8211; but the simple fact is that Fox just utterly destroyed this program.  It changed from a gritty drama to a laughable ratings-whore composed of LITERALLY trash.  Well, Fox, the public noticed&#8230;  You managed to alienate and infuriate the most loyal fan-base of all time;  Even they can only keep their hopes and dreams up for so long, and Season 8 has proven to be the last straw.  The ratings have dropped, the quality has continued it&#8217;s downward tailspin, meanwhile the only thing that has gone up has been the show&#8217;s production budget.   Finally; arguably 3 years too late, Fox has decided to put 24 out of it&#8217;s misery and cancel it.</p>
<p>So, what went wrong?  What happend?  Why did 24 limp into mediocrity?  Let&#8217;s run a comparative; Looking at a semi-similar series: &#8220;The Shield&#8221;  on FX.</p>
<p>The Shield is also a gritty drama.  The Shield has a similar &#8220;bad ass&#8221; main character &#8211; Vic Mackey.  And, it has similar struggles of that main character as their job and life effect their friendships and families.  Yes, the settings and plots are sometimes very different &#8211; but 24 could have learned alot from how The Shield bowed out.  The most important thing:  The writers of The Shield never changed the heart of their show.  They never changed plots to try and cater to the masses.  In fact, they gave us scenes that we didn&#8217;t even want to see (Lem).  They gave us a final two seasons that were literally gut-wrenching, made me feel sick to watch at times, and genuinely brought me to tears.  It was utter downfall&#8230;</p>
<p>But, it was a most epic and decisive series finale as can possibly be had.</p>
<p>24, your death is brought not by skilled and emotional content like The Shield; but rather by your own greed and lust for your success.  The higher your ratings went, the further and more over the top you felt you needed to push the show.  It didn&#8217;t take long for you to push too far, to the point where it became a cheesy satire of it&#8217;s former self.  You searched for meaning in more/larger explosions, exploitations of your main character, and trying to find the charm you once had.  You killed off the characters that everyone liked while keeping around all the characters that everyone hates.  You bring in new characters to fill in the same old roles.   You put a mask on recycled plot lines hoping nobody will notice, while you combine them and cram more of them in each season.  Well, you did it &#8211; and you failed.</p>
<p>You straight up blew it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re on your death bed and I&#8217;m not coming to visit you.  I don&#8217;t want to see you this way, and I have no desire to see how you meet your end.  I don&#8217;t owe you ANYTHING.  You un-deniably suck.  You managed to turn away your best friends at the most critical part of your life, and as far as I&#8217;m concerned you can fall into oblivion alone; reaping exactly what you have sown.</p>
<p>Good riddance; gtfo</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[SPOILERS FROM VARIOUS SEASONS INCLUDING SEASON 8.   IF YOU&#8217;VE NOT SEEN EVERY EPISODE OF 24 THEN READ AT YOUR OWN RISK]</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8230;   &#8230;<br />
</strong></p>
<p>24 has been a staple of my adult life.</p>
<p>From watching season 1 on DVD in pretty much a single sitting, to various fights and &#8220;plant activites&#8221; with Vanlandw, the awe-inspiring fate of Nina Meyers, and Edgar&#8217;s famous &#8220;CHLOE?!&#8230; AAARHRH&#8221; scene &#8211; The list of memories goes on and on.</p>
<p>But, for as much amazing and compelling drama as this show has produced; it has produced at least the equal amount of complete BS and sheer annoyance.  This trend seems to be correlated with each new season that has been released; with the exception of perhaps season 5.  With seasons 1 and 2 being near perfection; I think it&#8217;s almost a shame what this show has now become.  So begins my hatred and critique of Season 8.</p>
<p>I somehow managed to watch all of season 7.  I SOMEHOW looked past zombie-Tony.  I somehow looked past the over-use of &#8220;<em>Oh&#8230; Are you going to torture him Jack</em>?&#8221;.  I somehow looked past the constantly changing good/bad/good/bad Tony.  And, finally, I would say I was able to look past the annoying women characters.  Read: President Taylor; Renae; Chloe; President Taylor&#8217;s bitch daughter.  Really, the show is physically incapable of producing a female character that I do not hate with fiery brimstone furiousness.</p>
<p>I was going to try to reserve judgment on this season to let it get at least half way through &#8211; but it&#8217;s just not possible.  The list of complete BS that I feel the need to call out has grown past the tipping point and the spillage shall begin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chloe:  Why this show continues to kill off interesting and relatable characters whilst keeping this permanent annoyance is just beyond me.  I guess it may help female viewers relate to the show, but she adds merely a layer of stupid woman for all the action and real drama to fight through.  I hate Chloe.  In fact, I hate Chloe so much that I have vetoed it as a possible baby name even though it is my wife&#8217;s favorite.</li>
<li>Dana Walsh:  Apparently the top counter terrorism agency in the country just fails year after year to do standard background checking procedures.  I&#8217;m so sick of the mole/badguy/general shady person plot line in 24.  Dana Walsh apparently has some sort of questionable past that she&#8217;s running from.  So, she&#8217;s apparently used her amazing level of intelligence to create a new identity and get a new job with CTU.  Her hair is always waved over one shoulder.  And, her face just really bothers me.  Her existence enrages me even further since she&#8217;s the fiancée of Cole &#8220;Freddy Prinze Jr.&#8221; Ortiz.</li>
<li>Cole &#8220;Freddy Prinze Jr.&#8221; Ortiz: He is played by Freddy Prinze Junior.</li>
<li>Renae Walker:  Imagine this line being spoken in a Swedish Chef type of voice; Cus that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m saying it.  &#8220;Ooooh I&#8217;m Renae Walker and I&#8217;ve had such a tough couple years that now I&#8217;m a female Jack Bauer.&#8221;  Poor Renae.  She had it rough and now she&#8217;s an outcast who gets by and gets things done via her renegade attitude.  24 Doesn&#8217;t need a female Jack Bauer.  She shouldn&#8217;t be on this show in this season.  OH&#8230;. MAN&#8230; THERE IS A RUSSIAN CRIME SYNDICATE INVOLVED AND APPARENTLY THIS FORMER FBI AGENT JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE BEST RUSSIAN UNDER-COVER OPERATIVE ON THE ENTIRE PLANET!&gt;!&gt;!!&gt;!11..1.&gt;.    bs.</li>
<li>CTU Itself:  Chloe.  Mole/badguy.  Blue-tool headsets.  &#8220;We have our suspect, this is the only possible scenario &#8211; even though strong evidence points otherwise&#8221;.  Dumb.</li>
<li>The Plot:  The assassination plot has been done before.  The nuclear threat has been done before.  Apparently now they are mixed into the same season.  Jack can&#8217;t say the work nuclear correctly.  I hate when people say nuke-u-lar.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far I am really not impressed with 24, and I&#8217;m really doubting I&#8217;ll be able to watch it through the rest of this season 8.  CTU feels like a high-school in the valley.  Not a high tech counter-terrorism organization.  This is a pretty big fail.  I don&#8217;t like any of the new characters.  I don&#8217;t like the ones they&#8217;re choosing to bring back.  So far I don&#8217;t like the plot.  The only thing I&#8217;ve enjoyed this season thus far has been Jack&#8217;s kill by way of axe to the chest (Vanlandw where is bauercount seriously!).</p>
<p>In my opinion this show has long since run it&#8217;s course&#8230;  There have been quick glimpses of good television at points over a couple of the most recent seasons &#8211; but overall they have become fewer and farther between each other.  I&#8217;m growing tired of 24, and that is a very difficult thing to pen.</p>
