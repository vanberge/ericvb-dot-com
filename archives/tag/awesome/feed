										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&#8217;ve made a couple of subtle tweaks to my theme to fix minor issues that have bugged me for some time.</p>
<p><strong>1: The Completion of Twitter De-integration</strong><br />
First on my list was to button up the exclusion of my Twitter category.  For some time, I&#8217;ve been using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/">Twitter Tools</a> plugin to create weekly digest posts of all my Twitter activity.  I appreciate this functionality quite a lot.  I like being able to search a subject and find my WordPress blog entries AND tweets on the subject.  However, I didn&#8217;t like spamming readers via RSS or pushing down the real content of my site with what I&#8217;d consider &#8220;archival&#8221; content.  Ultimately I wanted to exclude the Twitter category from every possible area except if you actually click on the Twitter header link to get to that category.</p>
<p>Using a couple <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/better-twitter-integration">custom tweaks</a> to my theme&#8217;s functions.php file, I was able to mostly implement this back in 2010.  The Twitter category primarily only shows up if you go the category page.  But, recently I also happened to notice that the single posts have links to the previous post and next post; and unfortunately this loop didn&#8217;t read the standard WordPress query.  The previous/next post links embrace their own functions completely.  As such, these were showing the posts from my Twitter category.  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>With a little research on the functions specific to post navigation, I found it was pretty easy to ditch the Twitter category here as well.</p>
<p>Original code for the previous/next links:<br />
<code>&lt;?php previous_post_link( '%link', '&lt;span&gt;'<br />
. _x( '&amp;larr;', 'Previous post link', 'twentyten' ) . '&lt;/span&gt; %title' ); ?&gt;</code></p>
<p>Updated code for the previous/next links to exclude my Twitter category:<br />
<code>&lt;?php previous_post_link( '%link', '&lt;span&gt;'<br />
. _x( '&amp;larr;', 'Previous post link', 'twentyten' ) . '&lt;/span&gt; %title', FALSE, '28'  ); ?&gt;</code></p>
<p>The FALSE indicates that the next/previous don&#8217;t have to be from the same category, and then the &#8217;28&#8217; is the last variable which is &#8220;excluded_categories&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, the Twitter category now will really only show up if you&#8217;re searching or if you&#8217;re clicking on the Twitter link in the header nav bar.  I love WordPress.</p>
<p><strong>2: Double Sentence Spacing</strong><br />
Next up is the effect of my typing style that I cannot break.  When I&#8217;m done typing a sentence, I hit the spacebar twice.  This is certainly a debated point as to whether single or double sentence spacing is correct &#8211; especially on the internet.  It creates &#8220;rivers&#8221; of white space at times that can be a distraction, and can be a waste of page space and characters in database tables.  Even worse, my theme would display a quirky structure at times by moving that 2nd space onto the leading edge of a new line, hence starting the new line one space indented from the rest of my site.  It looked terrible.</p>
<p>Example of bad spacing, note the clear indent on the 2nd line:<br />
<a href="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/spacing-bad.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1550" title="spacing-bad" src="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/spacing-bad.jpg" alt="Note the clear space indenting the 2nd line" width="259" height="81" /></a></p>
<p>In my opinion, it&#8217;s better to single space.  I just can&#8217;t seem to do it.  I can&#8217;t manage to break that habit.  So, I scoured the internet for ways to make WordPress do it for me.  It didn&#8217;t take long for me to find a simple and easy function to handle this.</p>
<p><code>function remove_spaces($the_content) {<br />
return preg_replace( '/[\p{Z}\s]{2,}/u', ' ', $the_content );<br />
}<br />
add_filter('the_content', 'remove_spaces');</code></p>
<p>I added that code to my theme&#8217;s custom function.php file (the same place where I exclude the Twitter category), and all is well!  Wordpress adjusts my double spaced content into single space and displays it beautifully:<br />

<p>I love WordPress</p>
