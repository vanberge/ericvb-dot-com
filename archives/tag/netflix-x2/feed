I kept the motivational momentum going here and have made this plugin totally widget-capable.  Totally tested and declared stable as version 1.3!  Updated download links.</p>
<p>Over a year ago, I decided to take <a href="http://www.albertbanks.com/2006/01/04/wordpress-netflix-plugin-2/">Albert Banks&#8217; WordPress Netflix plugin</a>, fork it, and maintain it as a new plugin&#8230;</p>
<p>I did this because Albert&#8217;s version didn&#8217;t support newer RSS feeds that Netflix provided, and it lacked some functionality that I desperately wanted to have (displaying movie reviews I&#8217;ve written on the Netflix site).  So, I decided to maintain my own version for better, and for worse.</p>
<p>My interest and motivation to work on this plugin has drastically diminished lately &#8211; but today I got a transfusion of sheer inspiration to do some much needed house-keeping.  Ever since it&#8217;s inception in 2006 with Albert&#8217;s first version &#8211; this plugin has used functions from MagpieRSS to ingest and parse the RSS feeds.  Well, unbeknown to me this library has not been maintained since 2005 and never even made it out of beta status (even though wordpress&#8217; rss.php include file has it built in?).  I decided to bite the bullet today and make some modifications to my plugin&#8230;  Most notably it&#8217;s now using fetch_feed function from SimplePie vs Magpie&#8217;s fetch_rss function.</p>
<p>I had to modify some of my other code for pulling descriptions, titles, and links &#8211; but one of the users of my plugin had already started that for me so I just had to take it the last mile.</p>
<p>I did some other random cleanup, removed the annoying ^M characters that always seem to get in there when going from windows to linux, and I now call the rss.php include file instead of the depreciated rss-functions.php file.   All in all, it was a good day for the Netflix-X2 plugin&#8230;  maybe some day I will get around to improving the widget configuration!  Right now it just hacks together an unordered-list style widget and gives no other options.  but, hey&#8230; at least it is widgetized!</p>
<p>Feel free to try the plugin out:<br />
