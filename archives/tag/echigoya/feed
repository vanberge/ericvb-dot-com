<p><strong>Part 1:</strong><br />
First and foremost, the band &#8220;Disturbed&#8221; is apparently going on an indefinite hiatus after they conclude the Rockstar Energy Mayhem festival.  I&#8217;ll be seeing them play in Detroit with mixed emotions.</p>
<p>On one hand, this is a band that has produced alot of very good music.  On the other, they&#8217;ve also been the source of jokes and laughs at cheezy sounding grunts/rahs/suack.  It&#8217;s like their debut album was catchy, but we also made fun of it.  Their song &#8220;Prayer&#8221; changed everything.  It was epic and profound.  No longer the brunt of satire, they carried this respect through Ten Thousand Fists, and through some of Indestructible.  However, my unconditional love and respect for this band certainly ceased with the latest album Asylum.</p>
<p>Somehow Disturbed has come full circle in a bad way.  Back to their laughable and comedic roots, the video for &#8220;Animal&#8221; sealed their fate in my opinion.  It was cheesy and literally laughable to me.  I don&#8217;t really fault Disturbed for this; as I&#8217;m sure writing music and lyrics over a decade has it&#8217;s ups and downs.  I guess I am a little surprised at how far up they were; vs. how low they have come and gone to be.</p>
<p>As Vanlandw honestly and correctly put &#8211; &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s for the better&#8221;.  I think I agree, but it does still effect me to know that I&#8217;m seeing Disturbed on what may very well be their very last tour.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong><br />
I&#8217;m pretty sure I had viral meningitis last week.</p>
