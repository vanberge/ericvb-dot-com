										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our beloved fantasy football league, &#8220;The Worst People Ever&#8221;, has concluded another epic season of virtual competition.  I usually try to come up with a good team name, and this year I chose &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0fWP9CZGII">Delight and Angers</a>&#8221; which couldn&#8217;t possibly be a more accurate description.</p>
<p>In the 2010 season, I had a really good year.  Arian Foster and a quick Mike Vick pickup powered me to an overall 12 &#8211; 2 record and over 2,000 points scoring.  I did very well and I don&#8217;t mind saying that.  But, the regular season means nothing once you make the playoffs.  A singular loss by 3 points and the championship is no longer yours; and that is exactly what happened.  My brother defeated me, as I can only describe was perfect karma for the <a href="http://www.ericvb.com/archives/brothers-2010-rated-r-for-language">terrible defeat</a> I handed him in the regular season.  He went on to win the league, and I went on to 3rd place even though I all but dominated overall.</p>
<p>The 2012 season brought me a similar amount of success, although I was much luckier in many areas.  Calvin Johnson, Lesean McCoy, and Darren Sproles powered me to the same overall record as last season at 12 &#8211; 2.  I won 10 games in a row to start the season, but had a few close calls in there.  Two of my victories were achieved by less than one point.</p>
<p>I clinched the playoffs very early and tried not to get my hopes up.  Obviously anything can happen in this fake sport, as the previous season showed.</p>
<p>As playoffs started, I finished in 1st place and was fittingly matched up with a 4th place <a href="http://www.vanlandw.com">Vanlandw</a>.  He and I had a 1 &#8211; 1 split the regular season matchup.  I certainly wasn&#8217;t confident in an easy victory; but, I should have been.  My team put up the highest score that has ever been tallied in our league&#8217;s 5 year lifespan.  I honestly felt a little guilty&#8230;  Vanlandw&#8217;s team had put up enough points to beat any of the other 6 teams playing; and I still defeated him by more than 70 points.  </p>
<p><a href="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Blowout.Vanlandw.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Blowout.Vanlandw.jpg" alt="" title="Blowout.Vanlandw" width="302" height="249" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1584" srcset="http://www.ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Blowout.Vanlandw.jpg 302w, http://www.ericvb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Blowout.Vanlandw-300x247.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px" /></a></p>
<p>I allowed myself to enjoy the success and the notion of playing for a fantasy championship for the first time; and really the matchup was very favorable in my direction.  Payner&#8217;s team was lacking Matt Forte, Darren McFadden, and it was possible that the Packers may sit his quarterback Aaron Rodgers.  I really liked my chances and I was a very heavy favorite to win based on projected points.</p>
<p>Flo even gave me the league trophy a few days early&#8230;  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not one for superstitions, but he absolutely jinxed me by doing that.</p>
<p>The downward spiral started with Tony Romo getting hurt on the first drive of his game.  I literally scored 0 points at the QB position.  Shortly after that, Lesean McCoy was rendered with an ankle injury.  And with those two players each getting me an average of 20 points a game &#8211; I now had a 40 point swing to make up for.  I had strong performances from Calvin, Colston, Sproles, and even my kicker &#8211; but it was not enough.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m settling for 2nd place this year it seems, but I have put together back-to-back 12 win seasons and that is really pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Congrats are surely in order for Payner, and I&#8217;m not a sore loser here by any means&#8230;<br />
