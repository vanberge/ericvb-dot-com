					<description><![CDATA[I liked Bioshock but I mostly liked it for all the reasons that will sound insanely stupid.

First now that you have beaten it I would HIGHLY recommend to go though the Bioshock Wikia. Shit for everygame you have beaten go to the wikia. Halo, GTA. This will show you all the things you have completely missed. At least one article is a complete must read...

http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/Jack_Ryan

My favorite part about Bioshock is it&#039;s one of the few games that makes you feel like you are somewhere important where something important has already taken place. Most games don&#039;t do a very good job of making a place seem important after the fact. All the little touches and a story that at least SEEMS like they made a full effort to make a videogame for adults and not for the lowest common denominator. If you liked Bioshock for these reasons I would suggest Fallout 3 even though the game play is much different. 

I played Bioshock on &#039;hard&#039; and didn&#039;t have TOO much trouble and while the &quot;Vita Chamber&quot; is pretty much a &quot;checkpoint&quot; like most game have these games the enemies do not regenerate their health so yeah you can grind down all the tough parts minus the final boss. Vanberge said that he played using saves rather then vita chambers that is really a PC gamer way of playing but not a bad idea. I think on the PS3 version you can disable vita chambers actually they might have put that in o the xbox though a patch.

Regardless I agree with vanbergs I hope pt 2 doesn&#039;t suck I&#039;m glad they pushed it back to 2010. GG vanberge you are on an absolute gaming tear. Thank you for playing ODST with me that was like the most fun gaming I&#039;ve had in a long time brb.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am glad you finally got around to defeating the game, and as you helplessly watch your character pummel Andrew Ryan and realize why you&#039;re there doing what you&#039;ve been doing, it&#039;s just amazing.

If I had one complaint about the game at all, it&#039;s that it was too easy.  The player literally cannot die, and is just resurrected from the nearest chamber.  Made it feel like there was no consequences to running in with guns blazing and plasmids energizing.

Other than that, it&#039;s easily one of the best games ever.  Hopefully the sequel/prequel won&#039;t ef it up.]]></description>
