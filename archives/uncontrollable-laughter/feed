					<description><![CDATA[Here is the first verse of Prayer.

Never in order truth another dream which does not come exactly to praise your sorrow, another truth which cannot do another life your pain or which I take from you for you never to believe, the gift which it should add to suffering being hooked with all scream your hearts, and the sound which you who are made completely disabled have started hearing deaf it does the ear

How you get that from the original below, I have no idea.

Another dream that will never come true
Just to compliment your sorrow
Another life that I&#039;ve taken from you
A gift to add on to your pain and suffering
Another truth you can never believe
Has crippled you completely
All the cries you&#039;re beginning to hear
Trapped in your mind, and the sound is deafening]]></description>
